V34qejxNsCbcgD8C0HVk-Q,HQl28KMwrEKHqhFrrDqVNQ,5.0,"I love Deagan's. I do. I really do. The atmosphere is cozy and festive. The shrimp tacos and house fries are my standbys. The fries are sometimes good and sometimes great, and the spicy dipping sauce they come with is to die for. The beer list is amazing and the cocktails are great. The prices are mid-level, so it's not a cheap dive you can go to every week, but rather a treat when you do. Try it out. You won't be disappointed!"

Never, never, NEVER again (Back to Yard House for real food)"
5vD2kmE25YBrbayKhykNxQ,nlxHRv1zXGT0c0K51q3jDg,5.0,"This is definitely my favorite fast food sub shop. Ingredients are everything, and everything I see and taste here tells me that they're using top-grade fresh ingredients. The brisket sandwich is probably my favorite... and it's the one my wife ALWAYS gets. Unlike her, I often bounce around the menu to try different things. Definitely a step up from Subway, Quiznos, Jimmy Johns, etc in my opinion. As with all of my reviews, I grade each place relative to what I perceive to be its peers - so five star compared to them."
aq_ZxGHiri48TUXJlpRkCQ,Pthe4qk5xh4n-ef-9bvMSg,5.0,"Really good place with simple decor, amazing food and great hospitality. Very impressed with the lunch portion. Although service took little extra time but I have no complaints since they are quite new in business. The green curry chicken was good and to the right spice balance I asked for. I will definitely recommend this place to others."

The shipment was delivered the same day as promised.  We received excellent service from the first step into their showroom at their location on Dean Martin, all thru the delivery.  Very positive experience and great pricing for the quality items we purchased.  Very pleased and will be purchasing more furniture from this store."

I am glad I got to try something different of what I normally would because i was really pleasantly surprised. We also order one sushi roll because we had to try at least one and we loved it! Definitely will be coming back to try more things. Place is really small, and there was only one server, but we came when it was really slow and the service was pretty fast. All in all very happy we got to try this place out."

nVK00oKUk4asStkaOR09uw,ZbHE1ZncONeH-q93GuVGdA,1.0,"Horrible- Unclean, rancid, foul odors, unkempt, and poor service. The restaurant was nearly empty, and the cashier didn't even look up to say hello as my husband stood hungrily grinning at the counter. Needless to say, I talked him into driving up the road to the other location. This one is unacceptable."
EZ6g9a17UdMjtR-wrZebmA,wSAGILK2CFbq5BVZ5D67-A,3.0,The service is attentive. The decor attractive. But the menu is far too doused in polenta and paprika. The fingerling potatoes? Drenched in paprika. The aioli?Mixed with paprika. The appetizer? Fried polenta. The fish? Polenta crusted. It's worth a try. But be forewarned. The chef must shop at Costco.

I love my nails, they're so cute and symmetrical. Definitely will be coming back to this spa and salon! If you're thinking about going, Don't even question it, just go!"
hHFSpKcnDtJOs6M-JKFZ8Q,oCvxJBOs-Mbg-4oanPO7lQ,4.0,"The ingredients are always fresh and I like that I can customize everything. The price for the pita/salad is reasonable, but after the delivery fee of $3, it can be pricey. Definitely a great option if I forget my lunch at home."
lJBI50awi0N8qvX4PKzH7Q,3n685UjMonF4fjBcILXkJg,4.0,Room was very clean.  Staff was exceptionally nice for a mid-level hotel.  It had a parking lot right out the front door.  The free breakfast seemed generous (I didn't partake).  What more can one ask?    I'd stay here again.
NFebN50n-oXI7xgjP-Qixw,k1c_bC3DK6mKg797vH1T8w,5.0,"A very busy restaurant, make reservations, but well worth it.    Our party ordered the short ribs, salmon and steam bass for our main entrees and each dish was outstanding.   Will definitely go back to this restaurant when we are back in the Phoenix area."

I recommend this for anyone who has out of town guests for a little bit of the 'old west' and good fun.  All you can eat BBQ on Saturday and Sunday during the day."
Ir__fU1m6dBqgTrP3aLP9A,KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA,5.0,"I have been coming to this sweet little place for years and think they deserve my compliments. The food is french in a not too serious and snobbish way.  The wine is best enjoyed outside in the evening overlooking the ""lake"". They have live music (jazz guitar or piano) outside in the evenings most nights as well. Probably,one of the more romantic night spots on the west side.  They also have a fantastic lunch menu, with a lobster salad croissant that is true bliss..... mmmmmm.... Look them up for their specials, like wine tastings and discounted days."
YX1apap1DCOmOer3C9X2qw,77KuSFMOXqRGqcV9NJjzDA,3.0,"Food was piping hot, which is great!! Had the buffet...and it truly is all you can eat!! You order whatever you want off the menu (except chitlins) and they bring it out to you!!! Mac n cheese, greens, and black eyed peas were pretty good!! Fried chicken was pretty good too! Will come back!!"
Pvk862aBKxgn4i-yajH5ng,FooKqQJ3UnsIG2slFPuLRA,1.0,The tables and floor were dirty. I was the only customer on a Saturday nite and  the person working the counter ignored me I had a corned beef sandwich. I took three bites  and threw it in the trash
rHC67vLw-_pwoGjmEn-iQA,u8CFMZ9rCMDvKGDyqt6MEQ,5.0,If you are looking for a fresh yummy breakfast on the weekend in Waunakee you must try Cuco's. They have your traditional American breakfast choices or some tasty Mexican dishes. The food is fresh and comes out sizzling hot.   The service is excellent and the restaurant is very clean.
ica-FXNzyDzoOeArmg9Lwg,bM3ARXFMxGrntnHS6a7vEQ,5.0,"So I don't give out 5 stars frivolously, but this place deserves it. Everything I had (summer rolls, vegan pizza burger and chocolate chip cookies) was delicious. The service was great and the waitress helped me narrow down the never ending yummy looking options on the menu. They even gave me a smoothie sample while I waited.  Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll definitely stop back in. I may even be coming for dinner today."
HLaSqQMDVvlcFPGJL_kGCA,VMPSdoBgJuyS9t_x_caTig,5.0,Easily my favorite place to eat in Madison.  Great Lao-Thai food.  Curries are fantastic and make sure to start with a soup.  They're always good.  Tip: place is tiny and you will wait.  Either get carry out or head across the street to the Weary Traveler to grab a beer while you wait for your table.
MuMVzbBYfHXvwM93TZfx-Q,OK0ba4X5seibH8oMWh4bhw,4.0,"When it comes to presentation this place executes that one thing completely. The food tastes as good as it looks, but if you're on a budget this place my be out of reach depending on what's in your pocket. Even their establishment looks amazing. I love this place and love their ""screaming orgasm roll""!"
dZxXGlJtNwr9pag5UXCa4A,ACb637NG7EnswRs8U_BX_w,5.0,I travel lots for business and this is one of the funniest places.  Heather provided great service and NCAA B-BALL on the screens
FlkOUFwCf-OBYkCIXLGWcg,zTgzmZGHnZyqA_4xn8Fvvw,1.0,"Worst pedicure ever. First, waited over a half hour even though we had appointments. Then, the girl rushed throughout, made rude comments and talked and laughed with her other coworkers in a different language. Pedicure is chipped not even one week later. Will NEVER go back here. Worse experience."

lMIm1Ye7BeVE21xqlImqEw,eNFubUPJR7yIQah-NxZN_g,2.0,Decent food. Fishermen lobster or even congee queen can do better than this. Nice decor but that is it. I don't expect too much service from a Chinese restaurant but I gotta say that the hostess and waitress weren't welcoming at all. Won't recommend this place to anyone.
iAQFEArbXp1WUrseOFTLMA,gfhWUixZ4MmEAC1DtTsodA,5.0,GREAT SERVICE!! The food was amazing and very reasonably priced! Oh and the deserts are to die for!!

LWyUWSRmTzjfeDBCvdy7lw,Kk6k9cs4rXfDkC9Fjv0MjQ,1.0,"I had an oil change at the 15515 N Scottsdale Road location.  When the car was delivered to me, there were two engine warning lights on that had not been on when I drove the car in.  The technician said that the lights were on when he got in the car, which was not true.  I took the car to the dealer who said that a sensor light had been left unplugged when they removed the air filter.  I should have read the many bad Yelp reviews prior to going to this facility."
IZzkAUnRtJtw3tGNdZtrJg,V4sPxg8y29QDskQmMM1FIw,5.0,"This was my first time at this place and the shop was super clean. The staff was nice and helpful. Rose took care of me like a regular customer. If I lived in Vegas, I would come here all the time."

They said it was out for delivery. I said I knew that it was suppose to be delivered 10 minutes ago. 5:48. Still no pizza. Called the store back. Again, I was told it was out for delivery. 5:48 called the store again. When I was on the phone the pizza came. When it arrived it was COLD."
ffMc-TmUUhEbj5LLNILB4A,4ZbRwCB9oGibxK21MUZKHA,1.0,I went into this store yesterday and it was horrible!!! It was sooooo dirty. I'm talking there was trash everywhere!!!  Not only that but it smelled like trash! It was 5 o'clock on a Friday afternoon so I completely understand it being a little messy but the store just looked horrible!!! Not to mention the were out of pretty much everything on the store. I honestly will probably start going down the road to the next Smith's.
G5yx5pmozG-mXR-J8on6pw,gLOc1Fzl8yuKGq7B1TWj_A,4.0,"So pretty inside and well organized! I called for an appointment before my wedding for me and 3 others and was told they wouldn't be able to help me on that day because they were going to be too busy. :( So we went somewhere else. I had a gift card for here so I went here for my fill, and they did a great job, but a bit overpriced! I brought my daughters in so all 3 of us could get pedicures and had a great experience! Overall a great place!"
oAFF_A02Ws0mwH-lkbzyMQ,l_kefVF1frmC0xRW2YkvUA,2.0,"Pros: Fun atmosphere, great for people watching, mechanical bull is unique in my experience  Cons: I had the chicken tenders and fries and while the tenders were alright, the fries were pretty terrible. I've had fries that didn't taste good before, but these were the first fries I've experienced that actually tasted bad. After dinner, I felt sick and had to drink lots of water to get the taste out of my mouth. Would not go again!"

gkw9tSW_DuxSvhKLES9ePQ,MNaPOkqm2vKeNG8EqkZWCg,5.0,By far my favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas. Pasta Luigi is the fastest they have! Also try the stuffed artichoke. It is one of the best of ever had
LPva2snYp0Fdu8Z1QIXLiA,6ZIHxvFTHC1pvAzAS0uLDA,4.0,"What can I say?  The bread is made daily and the portions are reasonable.  They have a wide selections of desserts,  Asian drinks/candy/food,   and their sandwiches is made when you order."
iDJCA-MMb8LRpBEN5qIWrA,H464UiJ5c7q5dAJ14h731A,4.0,"Had a wonderful meal here. Rib steak for two with herb butter and mushroom onion sauce was excellent, cooked to medium rare spot on, lightly coated with Montreal steak spice. Tuna steak lightly seared just right went well with lentils and mint. I am withholding a star because even though the wine list was interesting and extensive, only three reds were available by the glass, and the pour was nowhere near generous."
aFXA_ZCpPWhsHVg1Uyjl4A,LLOCKcFIKbeWmiyCGytBSg,4.0,"Huge breakfasts served all day. ""the all American"" was very good if you want something simple. Service was spotty mostly because the waiters would disappear when we needed their attention. They were able to separate the checks which was great. The waffle was forgettable and expensive. I recommend egg dishes! If you need a quick yummy breakfast in downtown I recommend this."

He was unbelievably attentive, kind, and efficient! The food both times was amazing. As with anything down at the Strip, the food can seem pricey, but the quality and the amount of food you get is worth every penny! My favorite thing is the Short Rib Nachos. Also love the atmosphere. Highly recommend for anyone that has a stomach and is in Las Vegas ;)"

pvXNlamX78K_fQVUz8C3sw,NIPn7olHs6k3Svxy6DHUQA,3.0,Really good steak house. Steak is always seasoned to perfection but is never exactly coined to perfection. Make sure to ask for bread and butter you will need it. The butter is home made infused with honey and the bread always comes warm.  can't wait to go back again do a nice dinner.

The bad things are, no food, no bar, just vending machines a couch and a big screen TV.   The good thing is that this airport is so small, only American Eagle flies here, that when you show up for your flight, you can sit on the couch or an easy chair and watch TV while you wait for the security guys to show up. Then everyone on your flight (~32 people) go through security and get on the plane."

The music isn't great and $20 cover on Thursday made me cringe a little. Other than that, the club is designed really nicely (as are most things in Encore/Wynn). The drinks were typical Vegas prices ($9 beers) so overall it just wasn't great. I probably will not come back here."

Ice cream that comes with the combo  Come hungry and give it a try!

We tried the thai style noodle with beef which is their pad kee mow...and the beef combo noodle soup...  Super crowded and cozy...the service was good but there was a slight wait for food obviously...the beef combo noodle soup was very interesting... not sure I'd try it again because it wasn't spicy at all!

But fries don't make a restaurant. Where ever this chain started they need to go back.  Hate to see the kitchen if what they bring out is this bad. There's so many restaurants that take pride in cleanliness,this was certainly Doesn't!!! If you go don't say I didn't warn you."

-KCQtcA-TEqWtIFKmGN_2A,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,4.0,Liked how they were open late and also had happy hour specials after 10 pm. We really liked the bulgogi and Korean prime kalbi. They were marinated very flavorfully. The mushroom medley and sweet corn were also very good. Would definitely keep this place on my list of late night eats or when IIA just craving korean barbecue.
o6pljmlor3DJqUMiqvS67A,ZjKpGYdQCQPxzkYWAsV56w,5.0,If I could give this restaurant more than 5 stars I would. We always start with their wontons which are some of the best I've ever had and then get the red curry. The food tastes amazing and you can tell the vegetables are fresh. We have also had their BBQ chicken which is reminds me more of a curry chicken but is good nonetheless.
kTi96LP1DxwlFTe9jqkayQ,j9bWpCRwpDVfwVT_V85qeA,5.0,"I'm reviewing it on the basis of take-out.  I love their yellow curry.  I've actually only ever ordered take-out, but have ordered 5 or 6 times now.  Every once in a while I get a hankering for it and have yet to be disappointed.    I can agree with the other reviews that the decor is not the fanciest...it could use some updating.  In fact, I probably would not take my wife here to try Thai for her first time, simply because experience is important.  However, the food is good and that's what keeps me coming back.  I'm a fan."

0aHFybE0id9DD97QzAfNDQ,sSdHUsUZ4mvkb5ymIOJ_Aw,4.0,I had a durian mille crepe cake and the raindrop coffee. The coffee was delicious and the setup for the cotton candy was really cute! The durian crepe cake had a decent durian flavour but I would have liked it to have a stronger taste to it since I am a huge fan of durian anything. A little less cream would have been better as well.  The store itself was pretty cute too! Service could have been faster since it was a slow night but it's ok if you're just catching up with some friends.

Hs7tktWaOePcy7cJCXUjtA,1WtUgLhdBdQ39aBvEUbsnw,3.0,Akahana has a wide selection but food is pretty average. Their sushi isn't great but isn't bad.  It's one of those places you go to when nobody in your group can decide on where to go for dinner because of it's wide selection.

The Venison was perfectly cooked and the sauces were incredible it comes with the House rice which was also great. The Veal Marsala was a little too saucey for my taste but still really good.

My margarita was very good (not really worth the cost, but this is a touristy place).  Got the tequila ""flight"" which was 3-shots, one of each style of tequila and it was very good and a pretty good price for 3 shots of alcohol.

Margaritas shouldn't be made with sour mix, nachos aren't 4 large chips with toppings on each of them, and no one should need to salt their food when it comes to the table.  With all the superb dining in Vegas it's disappointing when you dine out and have a subpar experience."

I've tried a few shops in the area but this is the ONLY one now!!! Thank you.

The Bloody Mary was not too good though, it tasted premade, but the Montreal seasoning they used to line the rim of the glass was a nice touch. Atmosphere is nice with communal seating."

It should be a walk in and walk out kind of thing showing up with prepackaged boxes- wrong! Seriously UPS shouldn't allow them to represent their brand. It makes UPS look bad.

I can go to the 5:45 and 6 am classes or hit the 7:15 and 8:30pm classes depending on my schedule.   On top of the great instructors and class times, it is also really affordable.

They were wrapped in foil, but, they were not hot when I got back to work.   I wonder if they could warm the shells, too--just a suggestion.

The pierogis were authentic, made fresh in house, and filling. Every bite was deliciousness. All of the pierogis tasted good and we even recommend trying out the dessert pierogis. On the outside, the building looked sketchy but we were glad we weren't deterred away. The restaurant inside was clean and had a homey vibe. The service was attentive and friendly and we recommend checking out the market attached to the restaurant."

It is so loud that I sometimes can't hear my dinner partner across the table.  But none of that matters when you taste the food.  The pasta is outstanding, and served in enormous, enormous portions.  The menu is a bit cryptic - dishes aren't really described, only named, so make sure you know what you're getting before you order.    And it's BYOB, so don't forget your wine!"

At other times (like daytime) they offer a vegan soft serve in chocolate and vanilla.  In my case, my 2am pizza trip also featured a drunk twenty year old hitting on me. Thumbs up!"

The shrimp and hot and sour soup were good.  The deep fried stuff was mostly bread with a little piece of meat.  The salad was basic, lettuce only and maybe a carrot or two.  Wasn't really worth the $6.99.  Rather pay a bit more for something edible.  We won't be back."

For those who have only experienced gelato at places such at this, I only wish you could have tried Arlecchino Gelateria before it closed down.  That was the real deal."

Would highly recommend for a nice romantic date or to have a quiet dinner with a friend with beautiful ambiance. We had a steak and fish and they were prepared deliciously and fresh. Prices were very good for such a high quality meal. The restaurant accommodates about 25-30 seated plus there is a small bar. This place could easily be rented out for an intimate gathering as well."

Service was very good, tho my pad Thai and soup came out at the same time (but that's not the reason for four stars - I sparingly give five stars).  Overall, good experience and I'll come back."
wABVTM3rsPaMl5lYLvr1iw,di1cznKWsJlBR84geYytHw,5.0,Excellent customer service and very prompt picking me up! I also appreciated how they used an electronic device for the rental agreement vs printing out a bunch of paperwork.  It made it super convenient.

Ask for a Thai ice tea, and add a little dark rum if you're up for it. The bartenders are very nice and accommodating, and they even gave us sips of extra drinks he was making without charge. As with all authentic Thai food, it is very spicy, but you are able to order it from 0 to 5 spice level so that you can get exactly what you want within your tastes."

I am sure that the tacos were very authentic, but all of the dishes were a bit heavy on cilantro to me.  Next time around maybe I can ask that they hold cilantro.

I had an appointment at 2 and had to wait until 2:30 to start which is fine because my nails ended up looking good. I was probably in the salon for 2 hrs and all I got was an acrylic fill so it felt a little slow. Also, it cost $50 which was more than I normally pay for that service.

The owner goes to great lengths to get the highest quality beans he can find and it shows in each cup they brew. They roast the beans on site and take great care with each batch. The cafe itself is cute but the patio is very special. I think the complex used to house art galleries and the patio reflects that. Cosy, eccentric vibe. Check it out."

I definitely will be back!"

THAT is not a tuna sandwich.  THAT is  focaccia bread with a hint of tuna!  Pizza was really good!  Fountain drinks we're $3.00!   Never again will I eat here for the money they charge and the conservative portions."

The eggs were mushy, Taste like instant eggs with powdered cheese. One slice of toast, burnt on one side and not even brown on the other side. And to top it off the potatoes were French fries. Please don't waste your time and money eating at this place."
eTqEEhDaNPby1oZXFL1eoA,7_LXJ_VFRMGT0NvuY0sgRQ,5.0,Absolutely recommend this organization. First class experience. I used the valet service and when I came back they had my car running with A/C on and trunk open and a person there waiting to help me with my bags. When I gat in the car it had cold bottled water in the cup holders for me and my wife.  Quick and easy on 99 degree day.   I highly recommend!!!!!

One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as ""kind of like Coors Light"".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.    The food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though."

There were 8 of us and we had reservations..  The service was great.  The food was great and the wine list was a book of great wines available at all prices.  I will be back to try their dry-aged bone-in rib eye.  All of us that the whole evening was wonderful.
oWkqynBXgPy9db7GijMTwQ,hIUKufhwR6Ifn7bi0-phLA,5.0,"What I love about this place is that the owner Olivier and his parents (The Chefs in the back) care for you as a person and prepare your food and coffee with that in mind.  I was speaking to Olivier and mentioned my dietary changes and he offered to make me an Almond milk Latte with stevia, and his mother made me a healthy spinach omelet.  You can't find this type of service and care anymore.  The Baguette Cafe experience is well worth it every time!  God bless."
gtbTQDg1vmtnmgOcnbp_zg,wjLgM9Ybe5shoUPRrGMmsQ,4.0,"New favorite brunch spot in Pitts! Notorious for a wait but great coffee nearby at Espresso a Mano and shops to explore while you wait. Ordered the Eggplant Benedict. Never seen this on a menu before and did not fail to impress. Crispy fried eggplant, poached egg with a pesto hollandaise sauce and roasted tomatoes. Extremely delicious and was worth the wait!"

If not, we'd probably be broke,  and wouldn't be able to fit through normal doors.  Food and service is wonderful.   Although yelp classifies this is a bar, this is not typical bar food.  In fact, almost everything is made from scratch - including great desserts.   If you have never been here, you are definitely missing out."
mVVfJBBJ8OvhHsxncB4OWw,-U0liwRSHGYBEMYVj8kFmQ,4.0,"One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte!  The live music is entertaining and the older crowd seems to enjoy dancing and drinking on Friday and Saturday Nights.  I was introduced to Mickey & Mooch during restaurant week a few years back.  I am heavily addicted to the wedge salad, filet mignon fondue and the crab cakes."
k6oUsuhyJ2VtsdqIiD2oRw,_iEl9sCLsvXEFHUWPvgsAg,5.0,"This place is simply amazing! They have a marvelous selection of tequilas and make some of the best drinks I've ever had with it. We had their chips and salsa, as well as most of their happy hour items - which shouldn't be skipped! Our server Joe was on top of everything with helpful suggestions.  Some of their dishes take 15 hours to prepare. You won't find the cheapest fare here, but quality costs. I promise, they will wow you."

They have performed work twice now at my residence and have exceeded all my expectations. Most current job was switching outdated lights in garage to LED lights mounted to ceiling. Not only did they come early, they did the work in record time and I didn't have to wait all day! They called first to make sure I was home, awesome follow up!  Thank you Next Gen for providing quality customer service."
UtcbovfseS92JPloUWfNsg,qTmuW0C9XXuxWwumvn89sw,5.0,We weren't what sure what to expect from a 1:00pm comedy/show.  Maybe we weren't expecting a lot since the tickets were very reasonable (expecially through one of those half-price tix places) however we thought the show was great.  Glad we noticed the good reviews here on Yelp. Definitely a good choice to fill a couple of afternoon hours if you want to get off the casino floor.

Wait staff was a bit inattentive, but was nice and food was served fast.  Four stars because the food was excellent!  It was also inexpensive. We had a salad and four different rolls.  The bill was $26!!!   All the rolls were beyond our expectations and when the bill came we could jump for joy!  This place is definitely worth checking out.  Cravable sushi.  I recommend the kodiak roll (that rocked), an el pollo roll-- also yummy!!"

Immediately given chips and salsa. Nice thick, rich salsa and not pico  de gallo like some restaurants serve. Ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style.  Very tasty and huge. Great layering of flavors. Black beans were just how I would make them, so it's a winner too. So why only four stars? The food could have been warmer when served. I'd come back"

I booked this through the airline  (Allegiant). waiting no less than 50 minutes so far and no hope of the shuttle in sight.  I've seen a one driver go by twice, we still wait.  I came to Vegas for some much needed R&R.  So far I can't get away from the airport.  Call Uber, probably about the same pride.  Never again for this outfit."

Both dishes were made with excellent taste and I and a blast eating them. I would recommend this place to my friends any day of the week. Great customer service and great ambience. Also the mango shake was pretty good with the ice cream topping and I also like the strawberry shake as well. If anybody lives in the Rex dale area, stop by this place and order something off their menu, I guarantee you will not be disappointed."

Depressing tots, fries and onion rings, they were warm, not crisp at all. Had a corned beef, it was pretty decent, no where near NYC standards though. The best part was the Beaver Deli mustard, it was awesome. Wife enjoyed her fish tacos. Seating is limited and self serve on the drink machine."

The Peking duck  was served exactly how my sister liked (lean, less fat). Also, great service. My sister and I felt incredibly homesick after eating here.   Negative: I wish the Peking duck was served on a bao instead of in the wrappers; however, my sister informs me that the wrappers are more traditional."

Late Saturday I called Allstate and he was easy to talk to on the phone and assured me he would be at my house between 7 and 8 am Sunday morning. He was on time and replaced the pump in no time. With all the shady businesses in Vegas it's nice to finally deal with a down to earth businessman. . I have found my repairman from now on. Thank you so much

Request to sit on the patio and the fountain debuts every 15 or 30 minutes. The view is breathtaking. The wait staff is there for every need or accommodation. All high class professionals.

HGTdyEDygTqANThO64WDWQ,GI-CAiZ_Gg3h21PwrANB4Q,4.0,"The food here is pricey, but well worth it. The sides are served family style so you may only need two or three for the whole table. The steaks are perfectly cooked and the cuts of meat are the best of quality.  This particular location offers a cool area to sit in if you are fortunate enough to be seated there. It is a pod-like structure that is in the middle of the hotel atrium. It feels very cool and adds to the experience.  If you are looking to go big, this is a great place to do it!"
bV0rm1txz0T4UTWd8LTC6w,p0iEUamJVp_QpaheE-Nz_g,1.0,I had heard good things about this hotel but in my first and only stay it was pretty miserable. Vending machines on my floor didn't work the entire 3 days I was there. Internet was down more often than not. Room service unavailable because ovens were down. The 45 minute fire alarm at 3 am was the icing on the cake. I would not recommend this place to anyone ever. I'll make sure my company travel agent also takes this off the list.

Things that just didn't work for me- The green sauce was so blah I couldn't eat it without dousing it in the red to get a little flavor. The beans and rice were disappointing as well.

All I can say is that it is delicious!! It was a cute narrow restaurant with a diner feel. It was well portioned and had a good balance of flavours.

0Pj91NFPtXWeIDaLp2kuyw,zuUWG7OdMv6awFRYhEYT5Q,4.0,"This place really does it right. They have a small but focused menu, and the food is pretty basic: burgers, wings, pizza, and a few sides. But you can tell that they do everything from scratch and the quality is outstanding. I dare say the burger is better than Fatheads right down the street (also a great burger). Highly recommended!"
USMm3mKNzIGS8L6y6fH9hA,z_1n_57ANGutdEnfbWpTGw,4.0,"We have visited this location about 5 times. Most recently right before closing. The food was hot and fresh like always. Good burgers for a good price. The milkshakes, in our opinion, are not very good."

Food was hot, delicious and constant and service was great! Favourites included: garlic sirloin, signature steak, cornbread and of course the pineapple! Several times during the meal they checked to see if there was anything we wanted more of.  Live music was a nice treat.  We were reminded two hours after arriving that it was time to leave due to the time limit."
s6DMttJcJwME8p5sSiRFdA,N6BDiFk2CyJTMPGUlcOfAg,2.0,"The flavor was off, hard to describe but it tasted weird. I had the thai tea and my friend had a milk tea, both tasted weird and we've been to dozens of boba shops. The boba was old and very hard, when I asked about it the staff said that's the way it is and he implied I really didn't know what I was talking about. In addition, staff was abrasive and frankly kinda rude."
9df8KToLljo-v--Wke2W1w,Rb2s2-2kIvbPXnPEuM_OBg,3.0,Fun place...good food and an oxygen bar. My friend did a deal at the oxygen bar where she got a massage and some essential oils to relax so I thought that was a nice touch. We ordered a few apps and drinks. The vibe is fun and makes you feel like you truly are on an island somewhere. I enjoyed my tortilla soup and a friend had the spinach dip which was pretty good. If I'm ever at the Treasure Island hotel again I'd definitely pop in to hang out and enjoy some eats.

Little known fact is they have a lunch menu till 2 that is much cheaper and just as great.  They definitely train their servers to be the best!  Go.

Our favourites are the deep-fried cauliflower and the royal jade house special soup. On the latest visit, we asked for the ginger crispy beef made instead with chicken since we had one person that couldn't eat red meat.  The chef kindly obliged and it was AWESOME!  Definitely should be added to the menu. :)"

Normally I get regular movie popcorn with the white cheddar cheese seasoning, but the movie theatre ran out  (again). I expect at $6.50 for a 125g bag it would  taste ""gourmet""...not so much. Suffice to say I will never buy this brand again."

They even help you with your grocery's to your car every time. They give you coupons to free stuff. Make sure to get there before the evening to try the many samples.
eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g,viji5rHhNlsy9w-JmUhyaw,5.0,I must say that I was very happy that they brought back my favorite menu item braised beef and cheese tortellini! Ordered an appetizer Lasagna Fritta which was delicious! Ordered some white moscato wine which was very good and the hostess was kind enough to give me a free glass of red moscato just to try :)

It is not an exaggeration, but if you come here and do not try them, you've missed out on one of the valley most sought after gems..   In addition their other meat selections are very tasty, asada and cabeza being my next two favorite.."

Regardless, I have had their food at any number of events, and it never ceases to amaze!  In addition to eating in at their charming location, talk to them about catering if you want your event to be really remembered.  A high number of vegan and vegetarian options, in addition to those with meat.  These gals are truly accommodating."

Attentive with good suggestions but not intrusive. Casual open air atmosphere, causal but lively ambience, perfect for dinner with friends. My wife & her friend enjoyed a ""prickly pear margarita"" not too sweet very tasty!  Excellent food overall chips and salsa were fresh. Guac was tasty & paired well with the chips. We had 3 dishes perfect for sharing. Mexican street corn nicely spiced a bit messy but worth it. Nice fresh updated take on classic fare. Will certainly go back!"

I was really happy with the menu which offered pastas and salads. I usually order from Pizza Hut so it was nice to have other things on the menu. I ordered the chicken parm with spaghetti and it was pretty good. I also ordered a cobb salad, also good (get extra dressing). I have been eating those 2 things for 3 days! The portions are BIG! Anyway, overall 4stars for this pizzeria :)"
1UwJVPsIiQ1VpzRZhLftSw,4gwh0q7JsdzHIm_pdYUlZg,5.0,Shinbay was everything I expected it to be and more (which is pretty impressive as we had built it up in our minds for months before we went). We went there for my fiance's birthday and ordered the 5 course tasting menu. Each course was more phenomenal than the next. Keep it up! Phoenix is lucky to have such a phenomenal restaurant.
1pbnrEYKJIPVU5V5p8WBHQ,nMo0ozHO7cqsPaxw_7N6ow,3.0,"I learned quick you have to be aggressive here and demand people bring you food if you are ordering dim sum plates. I enjoyed the food and would return to try other items on the menu. We tried sliced pork, meatballs, shrimp noodle, shrimp and bacon wrap, fried dumpling, and something like oxtails.. I would recommend for those who are looking to try something new. It is definitely not Americanized so if you don't like traditional flavors then this place isn't for you."

I still love this place and just because Travis was so nice I will keep coming back.

I am in love with Eco Mist products -- I interviewed the founder of this company for an article I was writing -- and then rushed over to HD to try the products for myself. They are scent free, all natural, non-toxic cleaning solutions that leave your countertops shiny clean without any chemicals! I'm in the process of switching over all my cleaning products to environmentally-friendly alternatives and I'm planning to stock up on Eco Mist!"

UhEITrCcKXfADwO_YNakig,woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ,5.0,One of our favorites. Reservations are tough to get but well worth the wait! I don't want to invite my foodie friends from NY.  Everything we've tried is amazing! It's quickly becoming our go to place whenever we're in town.

The service was slow, the tables are too close to each other, and most importantly the food was horrible. My steak was undercooked and the waitress took it back TWICE until it got the way I ordered it which was well-done!! We waited more than 30 mins to get a table and after that another hour and a half to get our food!! Never going back again The only good side was that the fact that they removed my order from the total bill.."

Jacob and Troy prepared an asparagus appetizer for my sister and I while we waited for our food, and served with homemade ranch! Very small bistro, unexpectedly located in Monogram's salon, but very well kept and clean.   The asparagus was impeccable and delicious.  I ordered the Caesar sandwich. Chicken was tender and juicy and sandwich had the perfect cheese to chicken ratio. Homemade pesto was a great addition to the meal. Everything was made fresh and Jacob really knows his stuff!"

My husband went to Home Depot and bought a $14 snake and after about 15min had the clog cleared.

5x6njXK0KKFW1xFbnTfFvg,OK0ba4X5seibH8oMWh4bhw,2.0,Food is suspect but service is very good. Haven't been there for a while but went a couple times in the last month. The nigiri had a bad odor and the chef did not do a good job trimming the fish. Screaming O and jalapeño yellowtail sashimi were also cut poorly.  To top it all off the rice had a rock in it which resulted in a visit to the dentist to fix a filling!  I would choose many of the other local sushi restaurants long before this place.
mnJvynzRIYptrjyKtEBiTA,DKqhCd3Vwl3CEo8vUHhLYg,2.0,"Mediocre as far as Indian food goes. It's relatively more authentic than fast food chains, substantially more expensive, and definitely doesn't hit the spot. Very disappointing."
nDn9-IEz6JUGY0SJEYXnBw,VeFqptSzekFAc3FZOpi81Q,5.0,Favorite restaurant in Charlotte... Food is amazing!! Only complaint is the size of the place... Really small so it can be difficult to get a table. Although part of the charm is that it's a mom and pop type of place.. I highly recommend it!

Only to be cut by an entitled woman in her mid 20's and her mom, who had just spent the last 15min chatting it up loudly in the waiting room. Coming here was a huge mistake..."

The chips were a bit hard & thick. Avocado pasta salad was delicious- definitely order it again.  Tofu tacos were perfect. My 5yr old liked her shrimp kids meal. Beer batter white fish was heaven for your mouth....moist fish with oh so good batter.  Plenty of seats inside or outdoor patio."

The color coordination of the restaurant blends smoothly but stands out as well.  The food is great, you can actually taste 'fresh' in all of the items.

It's basic stuff - bagel with egg and cheese, omelettes, egg salad, soup, etc. Good diner food that comes out decently quickly.

A Coke promotion of a 24 can purchase gave a free 1.75 liter simply orange juice. As no 24 can package was available, I picked up 2 - 12  packs of soda. No manager or supervisor would honor the promotion.  As these disappointments happen too often, I have finally made up my mind NEVER to shop here again."

Make sure you take a box of macarons to go! They are the real deal.  The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is that it is a little too French - the portions are very small for the prices.

The pharmacist is extremely nice and so was the gal who helped me. They have free delivery too. The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because they don't have an automated refill line to request refills. Other than that, not a bad pharmacy!"

Other than that she was very nice. We ordered sticky rice, paradise beef, pad Lao, BBQ pork, and chicken wings. The only thing worth raving about was the padlao. Noodles were a little firm for my liking but flavor was on point. I told her just a little spicy and it was just that. Everything else is not even worth mentioning. Sticky rice was brought out cold.

They're also veteran owed and operated which you can definitely their work. Give these guys a shot, you won't be disappointed!"

Service was non-existent, the food was not good and the entire event seemed like it had been thrown together at the last minute - very disorganized.  Such a shame the way this place has gone downhill."

Two plantains and side salad, the bleu cheese is good, it blended well with a spicy sauce they brought to the table.  The grilled beef steak is tasty but a tad chewy.  Chicken is the way to go.  The drinks are 2$, refills at the station, the order is taken at the counter and a friendly staff member brings your order to the table with a smile.  Small, clean spot in the plaza."

The brioche french toast is delish as is the Hopple Popple and the Over Easy...i think that is what it is called with brioche, spinach and poached egg. Sometimes things come out in pieces like sides first, then entrees or vice versa. Patio seating nice too."

I actually was presented a different meal than I had asked for, but when I tried it, it didn't matter! Everything about this place is great - the indoor seating area is small but great furniture and chandelier gallery. The outdoor area is nice too. Staff friendly and timely. Definitely coming back again."

No glitzy smoothie bars or aerobics classes for ladies to get all dressed up trying not to sweat. The attendants are pleasant and readily answer questions.

Also the place is very clean and has modern interior design which is pleasing to the eye. If you're hesitant about coming here or even trying poke, don't be."

I've tried one of their escape rooms before, and the experience was definitely worth the price I paid.  I believe there are 5 in total and I will have to come back and try them all."

But you certainly I don't need to be a vegan to enjoy and appreciate the quality of the ingredients and the excellent execution. The sweet potato tamales were soft and flavorful, and the tempeh BLT was just about prefect."

And I genuinely mean this. I Love this guy. So genuine.  We had edamame and tempura to start which was tasty, but the real winner was the hot rock bibimbap and ginger honey tea. Throughly enjoyed both the food, and the dining experience."

I came here a year ago with my mother.  It was great and still is.  I came here a few weeks ago with my husband.     I was able to try a few different dishes this time around.  Oxtail Fries is a must!  Pork Belly Buns was tasty, the balance in flavors is great.  Pho was good and fresh ingredients.   Can't wait to come by to try their other small dishes!"

It took 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge my existence. Finally the bartender did, and when we asked about trivia we were told ""Well everyone here is waiting for trivia so it looks like you're out of luck.""   Walked out. Will never return after service like that."

Check-in was fast and simple. My favorite part was the relaxation lounge. There were books, oracle decks, crystals, tea, all kinds of things to relax and enjoy after your float. There was also a book you could leave a journal entry in, it was fun seeing everyone's doodles. Highly recommend this place :)"

I'm pleased to say I've been there since, and wow, what a difference that time has made!  While I still avoid the drive-thru because that's always super-busy, going inside has become a pleasant experience, thanks, in my opinion, to a new staff who are both friendly and efficient. I'm the only one who's noticed the change - the store is now regularly full inside. Yet despite the much busier atmosphere, drink times have gone down. Nice job, Starbucks!"

1DGt9rWx57JYbARbcPKrUQ,VBVqHnViRLSYAqP7v8iNNQ,1.0,"Low end chain Mexican food, coupled with bad service and cold ""sizzling"" fajitas earns this place one star.  Salsa is usually the first indication if a Mexican restaurant is going to be any good - the salsa was very bland and it just went downhill from there. We should have known when we went in and the place was mostly empty but we were really craving Mexican.  A real shame because it is in a super location."
7FdW2SGOF03KXnWgiVUpoA,c5TOGBUCCUUNBPM7h_KbmQ,5.0,"Upgraded version of Roberto's. Same menu, taste and price but better service and quality. Roberto's has recently changed their size for shrimp cocktail from 32oz to 22oz (med drink size) which is a lot less than satisfying especially for shrimp cocktail lovers. I'd prefer Frausto's over Roberto's. The service again is a lot more pleasant."

zlWSz4voG5SjJNQWW3rDnA,Ok9vikKusbG_Ue9pJf6s3Q,5.0,Exactly the place we were looking for. Guacamole is so good and you can add 3 different homemade salsas to get the spicy-ness you want.   The tacos are delicious. Good portion size.   Enchiladas are also amazing  Simple menu but it is perfect!  The restaurant itself is small but cozy.   Waiter was very friendly.

The flavors are all there and the portions are on par with other Thai restaurants nearby. My last takeout was very disappointing. I got the wonton soup and the soup was  ridiculously hot, temperature wise. The wontons were soggy and mushy. Their spicy scale is way different than what I'm used to. I got a level 2 green bean and I can barely eat it because of the spiciness. Please work on your consistentcy."

R_TJQ6Hy1BtOYK_hCl25bQ,_PKXarw3GjlbwbXhjdpUMA,5.0,So spicy and flavorful! Shrimp Pakoras really good and not too oily. Chicken tangra really tasty too (if you like chicken tikka masala you'll love this!). Appreciated the fact that the manchurian seafood rice actually tasted like seafood (instead of a oil-flavorless-spicy taste) and did not have too much food coloring.
OrTuYS6LBKX9_Ge1vJuw7w,UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A,3.0,This is some of the best food in Parma. Don't be put off by the run-down decor. This husband and wife duo serve up delicious Vietnamese food and fast. Spring rolls & #85 with tofu are my faves. I do wish they would take the crumbling artwork off the walls and invest in a couple gallons of paint though.

We needed a place to hold an impromptu family gathering and they were very accomdating to our large crowd at the last minute.  They have ""The Patriot Room"" that is so cool.

Most of all I like that when you eat it the flavors don't taste like powder. It is so smooth and velvety!! They have tons and tons of different topping more then any other place I have ever been to. I knocked off a star because when I walked in the guy behind the counter just left and went to the back and wasn't around for a good 5 mins. We had to wait for him to come back to pay.

If you are a meat eater you definitely should try the grill pork Banh mi. The pork is tender and moist. The bread is warm. I had the vegetarian banh mi and it was delicious. I am glad they open near the University. They are generous with the portion. Amazing Thai tea.

To check in was a breeze everyone there was great I do recommend that you pay the extra 20 dollars for the renovated room. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because every way you turned the staffed tried to sell my boyfriend and I a time share. Dinner at the sushi restaurant was great well priced and the staff was attentive. We will definitely be back especially after all the renovations are done.

The texture reminded me of a thicker smash burger. I did not like how red it was throughout. I wish I would have known so I could have ordered it well done. There were a few bites I didn't eat because of how red they were.  The bun is too soft and gets soggy from the hamburger juice.  Overall I think it's overpriced for what you get.

But my thing is, I think everyone should know what kind of person they are going to deal with here in their sales department.    They have bait and switch guy in the internet department, inexperience green peas salesperson and douche bag sales manager. If you are still going to this dealership to get your hyundai. Well, you have been warned. You can take of my review again Yelp if you think it doesnt fall within the guidelines again."

Food was ok and the food came slow even though only about 4 couples in there but service was good until I had to go ask to pay as server had disappeared talking. Then the bill with tip over 80 bucks.  Half that price  maybe would of let it go but 80?   So won't be repeating."

msU_0GeWMr5aKaAje6pqhA,S8FDnhP4WKlRhJxSIkcxFg,3.0,"I really like the concept but a little pricey, guess you can expect that as it is entertainment driven. I have not taken my kids yet due to pricing and time restraints. The food was really good and drinks are great. The guns had a few issues though taking up some time overall they made an effort to corrwct. I will eventually try it again with my kids hopefully on a weekday when it's more cost effective. If you haven't been I would say you have to try it."

I got the $2.99 deuces wild (2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 pancakes) it was perfect, the over medium eggs I ordered were cooked perfectly. My husband got the prime rib sandwich with fries for $7.99. The prime rib was cut thick and piled high and served with au jus. I would 100% recommend."

The buttermilk bar was so moist with just the right amount of sweet. The people were friendly enough.

Nice staff here makes up for the super long waits and lack of appointment times. They recently moved across the parking lot to what seems a larger space.

The nurses do joke a lot but really care about their patients.  Noise and commotion travels and is disturbing at times but,  it's the clientele not the staff.  I would say,  the appearance of the ER definitely needs improvement.  I would recommend this place if I wasn't laughed at by my friends."
8tdpq4NS0rd9c0eyy9M2lA,2aWV8Rx4TwtB0x2pfIPNxA,2.0,"As others have noted, the prices are high for what you get ($15-25) for burgers and $10-20 for glasses of wine.  The atmosphere was nice if you can snag a booth, more cozy than the sports bar further up the concourse.  The burger was a bit overdone, as were the panko chicken tenders.  BBQ sauce is the sauce of choice.  The wines were of acceptable quality, at least if you are going to pay a high price you get something that is OK."
FTsRfaVbDUB6Sc6pL-J80w,XQm5LDv3M9d4zDtKRO_8iQ,1.0,"The people here are extremely rude. No one will even bother to hold the door when you're right behind them.  I tried multiple times to book classes online and couldn't get anything to work.  The staff doesn't seem to know much about anything either. Took me 3 tries to cancel my membership, which I rarely ever used. There was one really nice girl from North Carolina who worked here though, she really tried to help, but that's about."

The most notable change is you now only get one side when you order a sandwich, but the focus is where it should be, on the sandwich itself. The portion of pulled pork is now much more generous, and was also tender and quite tasty. Definitely a step up from what they used to be serving."

I told the hostess to bring whatever the cook wanted to put together, and the meal I had (spicy lamb) was great. A previous review hit it on the head: authentic. The food was flavorful and they use good cuts of meat. I had a huge dinner for under $12, and the lunch specials are even cheaper. If I was going to school in Charlotte I'd be eating here regularly. Very friendly and helpful staff, will return on my next trip."

NQVpwQvUaJeiR8xXBjoffA,hihud--QRriCYZw1zZvW4g,5.0,"The food here was amazing. We ordered the Las Vegas platter for 4 and there was a ton of food. For 4 adults it is a really good amount. Make sure you come hungry. I also recommend the bulgogi bibimbap. It was so tasty. Really, there was nothing we did not enjoy. The sides were good and plentiful and the meats were seasoned very well. The only thing we regret is not being able to finish it all because we got so full."

zWWcik1fRPZviBCQLC26FQ,9Eghhu_LzEJgDKNgisf3rg,4.0,My second visit here was much better because I ordered the right dishes this time I think. The carbonara pasta was pretty decent and the caprese salad was delicious once again. The naked mozarella was awesome and very unique. This place is a solid 4/5 as long as you avoid the spaghetti and meatballs (overly salty) and garlic fries (overly sour). The service was great and the atmosphere is pretty nice too.
ZwRtFlUEMMqxlfm_RXnOCw,Ki8seQY5mtXc36xjoMfeDA,5.0,"Fantastic meal, pizza made just like we wanted it. They added pepperoni to half of our Bacon & Blue with barely a raised eye.

Highly recommend for a cocktail afterwork or Friday night downtown!"

But don't take it out on my kids and I because you hate working here. Food made wrong, reminded several times our ice cream order and still got it wrong 3 times. And then got pissed when we asked for the right ones... figure out the simple stuff and the big stuff will take care of itself. Not very complicated to treat people like they matter."

Other high end stores will accept returns even after you have worn the shoes if they don't fit or cause blisters etc.  saks refused to accept a return for a defect in the shoes and doesnt even have a shoe repair person to atleast fix the defect.
yVFHAkreo5X7iaqWaQ9aOg,144FjoXIVwYaUZ5wXttAIg,4.0,Hotel exceded our expectations. Beds were VERY COMFORTABLE. Room was clean. Missed with TV channels but that was snafu with Time Warner Cable digital conversion. Smoking rooms need to be all on ONE FLOOR FORTHWITH! Owner take notice. We as non-smokers don't want to smell those carcinogens for one instance! Front desk staff lead by Aaron and Kati were a joy to converse with. Deana (Dean-ah) was a tremendous host at breakfast. She was a good conversationalist and assisted in anything we asked. Overall we would recommend this hotel and would stay here again.

Well I don't know if it was magical since I didn't see any sparks or flying pigs (flying veal?) but it was quite a tender piece of meat. My friend's whole wheat spaghetti was quite disappointing, such that she could not finish the dish. Overall not bad for an Italian restaurant, but would like to visit again to try out other menu items."

From the assistants, to the hygienists, to Dr. Davis, they all are beyond exceptional. Dr. Davis is a very talented and efficient dentist, and at the end of the day, is the most honest dentist you'll have. He shows you all your options and will be genuine about what needs to be done and when. He is very compassionate about his work, which reflects upon the impeccable quality of dentistry he provides. I'd recommend this place for your dental needs."

They brew Ancora coffee, which is made right in Madison and very, very good. I rate their coffee better than Peet's or Starbucks, both of which are available nearby.

I guess these days every hotel in Vegas has to have a trendy Asian fusion place with groovy bathrooms.  The ones here are like really upscale porta-potties or large airplane bathrooms with high ceilings, with tiny little LCDs playing music videos.

But, I wonder how much soju was, actually, in there because my friends and I bought must've been 7 bottles of soju in an hour half span and I was still standing. 3 bottles at Bazic get me blurry.  Soju was presented in a Patron bottle which was a nice/cool touch; BUT, the bottle was soooooo sticky. Obviously because it spilled out when being poured in.  Whatevs. Meet me at Bazic up the road."

Everything was authentic. The songs, the costumes, their impersonations, everything was top notch. To be fair, George looked kind of old to be doing the part, but all that aside it's still a great show. So if you're a Beatles fan on a trip in Las Vegas, give this show a watch."

Carpet needs to be vacuumed and cleaned more often or get rid of it and replace with tile. Very unsanitary."

You get a huge plate of food -- I had sausage, home fries, and eggs, and my guy had French toast -- for under $10.  It's not especially fancy or gourmet, but it fills you up and hits the spot.  Coffee is decent, and your cup is continually refilled.  Service is friendly and efficient.    I'm from NJ, where we take our diners (and our diner breakfasts) seriously.  Coach House passes muster with me!"

Mexican food is known to serve too much that's like a trademark attribute of Mexican restaurants. The tacos were TINY and the tostada should be called the tostadita it was so small! My husband and I were still hungry when we left which was sad because the food tasted good and the place is beautiful but the portions were offensive

Oddly enough, I went in the first place because of good reviews I read here on Yelp.  Needless to say I was suprised with bad service, and burned food that was tasteless!

Make sure when they offer a Groupon you jump on it.  It really makes it worth driving all the way out from the west valley for some water fun.  The park does need maintenance and painting thru out the complex.  This park is not state of the art but a good time was had by everyone.

However, if you come during the week, you may get lucky and you will be accommodated.  Staff members are great, always smiling and willing to help out.  Good selections of accessories for all Apple products, some more pricey than online stores.  Advantage of buying the accessory at an Apple Store is a staff member will gladly install or help you out with it.  It's all good..."

The family owned deli is a gem in a city of coal. Their customer service is outstanding especially in reference to their first time customer routine where the give you samples of their popular sandwiches. The prices are fair especially considering their portion size is equivalent to two. If you're looking for good food & a respectable loving family environment, look no further."

Although we were very clear to communicate up front that we had a show to get to, that didn't seem to matter to them.

The restaurant is mostly focused on take out and delivery, which means they don't have a lot of tables. That's actually a good thing. It has a nice intimate atmosphere, not crowded.  Because they don't have tons of tables, they focus on making good food. We ordered the Orange Chicken, Wor Wonton Soup, and Egg Foo Young, which they make fresh, unlike other restaurants.

To walk into a restaurant and order coffee and then sit and eat food you've carried in is just plain rude. If it were my establishment I probably would have asked you to leave.

De plus, la sélection des brevages est intéressante (ex.: liqueur en bouteille et canettes de boissons italiennes, eau gazeuse, etc.) Cependant, évaluez ce que vous faites par la suite,  car les épices et fines herbes donnent mauvaises haleine... :)"

I've not tried their regular pizza, but their Chicago stuffed style is the best I've had in Madison.  And their sandwiches are very good as well. They have a fantastic selection for a pizza delivery place, and they deliver quickly."

I usually end up buying something because I know I won't be back for another year or two but it's hard to shell out $68 for a sweatshirt or $40 for a simple T-shirt.  But I will admit that my granddaughter looks adorable in her $25 Roots shirt!    Who am I kidding with the complaining?  I'll be back next year with the credit card in hand.

Which is good...thf price ranges from 10 to 17 bucks Canadian.  3. When you order make sure you say wrap or platter. My friend wanted a wrap and got a platter. Hence the 3 stars  4. The garlic sauce that comes with the potatoes are so good...if your not a garlic fun ....then u won't like it. But if you are....heaven!

Although it's a bit pricy for chinese food, I think the prices were still ok, based on the rent they might have to pay inside Caesars Palace. Their freshly made noodles, especially the hand stretched ones, were really yummy. And to compensate all the bad food and drinks in vegas, I recommend a healthy stay at this place."

My dish came with roasted pork which tasted good but I personally prefer pork belly with my ramen.    Their dumpling was very delicious. It tasted very well with the sauce (I think it's vinegar).   My food experience here was good.  It is a good ramen place but not my favorite."

Waiting for 20-25 minutes to talk to someone when I had an appointment, not doing the job right, having to return because center caps were loose, airing my new tires to 40psi when oem is 60 and 70 and telling me it will only take 40-45 minutes then taking 2 hours. Then having to spend an extra 50 bucks because somehow my pressure monitor went bad while they were changing my tires. It's truly disappointing."

But realistically thats kind of what I expected being as it's a restaurant owned by a Food Network Chef. I had the 16 spice chicken, and it was a tasty entree. Though, now that I am writing this review a while down the road, nothing particularly stood out to me though.  However, if you want to dine in a big restaurant, owned by a big chef, and Southwestern is your thang, I'd say check it out."

The crab cake and slaw were my favorite of the 3, but all were good.  Got a blood orange mimosa, but wouldn't recommend it. It's mixed with cider, not champagne, and the drink felt heavy for brunch."

You think that surely there must be something healthy available.  There won't be.  And you'll have the pleasure of breathing a ton of smoke while you choke down about 2000 calories of (whatever you order).  You'd think it might be cheap since the casino wants to keep you there so that they can keep making money on gambling.  It isn't.

I don't know if it's the fact that the owners feel that they now need to cater to pretentious Thornhill patrons, or if it's because they opened a second restaurant right next door, but the service and quality has dwindled as of late.  They have a cute coupon card.. visit Maki 9 times, and your 10th time is free... however, prices are sky-high ($24.99 on a weekend), and tip (15-18%) is always tacked-on to your bill.

The hash browns were fairly crunchy, and the toast was the typical crappy bread soggy with cold butter  they give you in breakfast joints.

We arrived early enough to beat the crowd.   I was pleasantly surprised by the food...and drinks. Pretty tasty and the menu was extensive. We had wings and sliders. Wings have a kick so they aren't for amateurs. And the sliders inspired me to go buy Hawaiian rolls and make some myself! They were really tasty.   Bring your wallets.

We came in not knowing what type of cuisine they served and our waiter came over completely ready to answer any questions/uncertainties that we had. With their Vietnamese cuisine today we ordered: -Pho Tai (?) -Spring Roll -Fresh Coconut (drink) We didn't order much since we weren't sure so we shared the meal. I enjoyed every single bite.  My favorite dish is the Spring Roll and District One nailed it. Keep it up."

The atmosphere was fun and lively with some entertainment, but definitely not a quiet romantic venue. I've never been to a sushi restaurant where nigiri sushi was just one piece, so I ordered some thinking I was getting two for $5-$10 but instead it was literally just one tiny slice of fish for that price. I also ordered the sashimi tacos which turned out to be bite sized. Overall, the food was delicious, the portions just didn't equate to the price."

Dry, from the box-like taco shells housed tasteless meat, uninspired toppings and ended up being probably the worst taco I've had in my life.  The nachos were thoroughly bad. Gross cheese, and the chips were round! What self respecting Mexican serves round tortilla chips?  The ordering process was painfully inefficient and the staff were not the friendliest.  Why this place thought they could compete with all the solid places on Queen St. to get a taco is beyond me. I give them 6 months and they'll be gone."

The food is mediocre and the service is way below par.  I waited a good ten minutes before a waitress came by to tell me she would be right back to take my order.  5 minutes later she came by.  Coffee cup was filthy.  The overall experience was just lousy.

The waffles are warm and cripsy on the outside, and ridiculously soft and fluffy on the inside.

They still have a great cheeseburger and volcano nachos.  The other appetizers we had that we used to like just haven't tasted as good in recent trips.  The quesadillas had a seasoning on top that wasn't very good and the chicken was dry. The boneless chicken bites didn't have much breading.

The complete wash is not as elaborate as it had been, and is not as thorough as other washes in the area.  Convenient location to the area is what it has going for it."

The only problem with this restaurant is they don't take reservations and the wait, they take your number down and call you later, so if you come late night you might be waiting for awhile. Other than that the meat quality was perfect and try all of the side dishes because they compliment the meat very well. This is my new favorite place."

The chicken enchiladas were good due mostly in part to the addition of over easy eggs, but the banh mi was fairly disappointing. It's certainly unrealistic to expect amazing things from a Vietnamese sandwich made by a brewery in Scottsdale, but the item was very poorly flavored and constructed. Additionally, the service was abysmal. I often don't even notice poor service or whether certain items take a long time to be prepared, but Four Peaks really disappointed me in that regard."

The food is amazing. My favorite is the one with octopus, but a little overpriced. The chorizo taco, duck taco, and shishito peppers taco are all great too. The street corn is awesome when they have fresh corn on the cob. It's not as good when corn on the cob is not in season, and they use can corn served in a bowl."

They always give you a heaping mound of each dish, so you never feel you're not getting your money's worth.  There's an extra $0.50 or $1.00 for some of the more premium items (shrimp, added bacon, etc) but it's always worth it.

They need to just shut this place down I've given them so many second chances and will never do it again. When you complain to corporate they send a free pizza for the same location -- how dumb!!! I hope they shut down and something decent fills this prime spot.

The owners are French & their cuisine is unmistakably so.  It's nice to have a simple French bistro that is reminiscent of the croissant shoppes I visited in Paris.  Vegas valley needs more quaint mom & pop shops just like this.  I am keeping this one on my repeat list.

Dealt with many invoicing and billing errors and their customer service department is terrible to deal with.   Just found out that the Costco program was discontinued and my bill is literally TWICE the discounted costco amount.  They claimed to notify customers but I never received anything.  Cancelled service - not worth the price they are charging now.  Save your money and invest in a water cooler and get your bottles elsewhere!
USxEmPm-M-TMDFoFRDo-7A,HccqNuvwDCrnAAM5e5lQ_w,2.0,I really don't understand the hype surrounding Dunkin' Donuts. The donuts are mediocre and so was their coffee. The only reason we made a stop here was because the Los Angeles location always had a line wrapped around so we thought we would give this a try. Variety was lacking and the old fashioned donut I tried tasted like it was left out overnight. Not fresh whatsoever. Two star experience for sure !

EaC2ISwJBDHUBFK_UjORBg,owxcYAUca_6K6BAUX4V48w,3.0,I totally agree with the reviews about this place regarding their service. They really don't check on you to see if everything is ok or ask if you need more water. The place only had two other people eating and 2-3 workers walked by plenty of times. I had to finally ask for some. I rated them 3 stars because I did enjoy my food but no so much their service.
WSx714tFoxyLma2ZXAbCXQ,yJ5rA9U6nmSEUV8_j_jYHw,3.0,"the server gave one of the people in my party a horribly cracked cup, so we asked for another one. The cleanliness is never a strong point of Chinese Dim Sum restaurants, and it should be noted that you should clean your cutlery and plates before eating an extra time to make sure you aren't eating someone else's leftovers.  The service and food was pretty average in comparison to the other dim sum restaurants nearby. The restaurant was pretty empty, which probably explained the quick service and quick food we got that day."

Rp2hjfeptufMFw7NfKts2Q,OJ8FKDGWI5jo0MwUv496AQ,1.0,Only rated it one star because zero was not a choice.  Apparently -- and I say this in total seriousness -- customers who show up in person are the stores lowest priority.  I have watched them fill orders for 15-20 from fax or email while TOTALLY COMPLETELY 100% ignoring the people in line.    This store needs a manager who can handle a rush.  They should also tell people who are 10-15 people back in line that the wait could be as much as an hour.   Ridiculous.
Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,ZFyJ83LJkkO1dP82kzXKNg,4.0,Not really much to say that everybody already said about raising canes the chicken is delicious love the fries and the texas toast that they give you with sauce is okay at best wish they had ranch but it is what it is love the service as well and it is one of my favorite places chicken that is to eat at I still love the Charleston location but this comes second out of the raising canes location so if you haven't tried this place out I recommend you to give it a shot.

Also, he rushed into the clinic 10 minutes late. He gave me my full time, though. No self-care prescribed. A BIG turn off for me was the POS machine prompting for a tip. Really?? This is a multi disciplinary clinic, and you're *requesting* tips?  This seems highly unprofessional for regulated health care professionals."

Our waiter came by a few minutes after 7 and informed us that we couldn't order from the Happy Hour menu.

We tried maybe 10 to 15 different dim sum varieties including the deserts and it was delicious and seemed fresh. My personal favourites were the BBQ pork pastry, the deep fried mashed taro balls and the tiny bee desert.  The interior is interesting with dimmed lighting. I caught myself looking at their nicely decorated shelves all the time which had also interesting lighting.  The service was not too bad although the waiters aren't the friendliest folks.  We will definitely go back."

The client that I had to pick up made several comments about the vehicle. It was pretty embarrassing.  Upon my return, I called Hertz to get their address for the drop off location. They gave me the address to their corporate office, directed me several miles out-of-the-way before I caught on.  I rent a lot of cars... This was the worst experience in a long, long time."

I guess good food, nice decor and great service builds regulars.   I had the uncle Louie salad which was good, nice serving and with a lot of flavor.   The penne wild mushroom was super good.  A nice touch is that the owners (I assume they were the owners) talked to us a couple of times. Not the typical annoying manager/owner who engages into an endless conversation but a gentle genuine courtesy chat.  All in all a very nice place."

I've been working in the food Industry for 22 years and to receive a C score in a restaurant is because something is wrong besides the fact of dirtiness. Didn't eat and asked for my money back. A place like this doesn't deserve no star (s) but in order to post this comment I was forced to rated it with at least one star.

But, we were told the upstairs opened at 6, so I am guessing there would have been much more seating.   The drinks were excellent!

The dog had a perfect ""pop"" when you bite into it (essential) and tasted just like it does in the states but with better tactics. The sports peppers are thinly chopped, which are the main difference. Other than that. Everything else tastes exactly the same. Spot on!"

This was a gel manicure which I was told would last 2 to 3 weeks.  When I went back I politely asked if they could just remove it (I did not ask for any refund though I should have) and then they wanted to charge me to remove it! Inexperienced staff and overall overpriced for all services. Also, tiny for selection for charging 20 dollars extra. I chose the only neutral colour they had."

I stopped in for a lunch special which came with soup, rice, small fried spring roll, and entree. The soup was rather plain and unimpressive  the stir fried beef on the other hand was quite tasty. The sauce they used was delicious. And when I said I wanted it spicy, they sure made it spicy! Good on them. The employees were all very nice and accommodating as well. Highly recommended."

Sakana still has the best fish to rice proportion of nagiri I have ever had. The albacore nagiri with the garlic sauce is simply divine and the salmon was fresh. Same with the honey toast for dessert, my only minor complaint with the toast is that it stuck to the bottom of the dish (not a big deal though). Definitely planning a return trip soon."

Best buffalo chicken wrap in PGH so far (been a lot of places but I haven't tried everywhere obviously)  chicken pesto is fantastic. And hands down best ranch in PGH.

I've had Thai at many places in the valley and after seeing reviews I had high hopes for Malee's, but the food didn't do it for me. Good location, good service, but overall I'll go somewhere else for Thai next time."

However, there's a menu located at the front register that you can check out.   There's a good flow, seems like they got their system down.   There's two size on the drinks, regular and large. The honey boba was made perfect. Not too hard, the perfect kind of softness. The wait for the drinks was pretty fast."

1zbThU8H0-f76yrX1xIZ5g,PWGIAIXAoh91nayfIOQMTQ,3.0,I like the food at Panera. This location is fairly nice but parking can get crowded during high-demand times. The bagels are about the best in the city in my opinion. The staff is constantly changing so your service will vary depending on who is working. One thing I wish they would improve is their toaster. If you want a toasted bagel ask them to run it through the machine twice. It's a chain and very reliable. Sometimes I wish they'd change the menu more often but overall it's a good place.

The line is usually slow and the placement in the parking lot makes it accessible only if you're traveling East on Bell; otherwise it's a lot of parking lot to work through to get to it.

My boyfriend and I usually like to get our fill of cheap but satisfying sushi from Sushi on Bloor, which isn't particularly close to us. Since this place has opened up, we've completely abandoned Sushi on Bloor. Moons' sushi is slightly more expensive, but it makes all the difference in the food's quality--it's SO much better."

The service was awesome, but the food was just okay. I had to return the waffle to be cooked longer, but it had good flavor.  One piece of bacon was rubbery, the second too crisp (microwaved?) and the potatoes were hard and crunchy. Don't know if we will come back, but I'm sure they will improve with time."

Flavors are pretty decent, even though is a bit pricey; $3.25 for a very small child-size scoop. If you want the scoop in a cone, add $.75 and so on. The worst part for me was the customer service is definitely lacking. We were not acknowledged as we entered the small establishment, I felt like I bothered the employee by asking to try 2 different flavors and she didn't even smile once. I will not be back."

The cafe has many healthy options to chose from: salad, sandwiches, soups, deserts, and drinks.  The staff was friendly and pleasant. I had a sandwich and green drink.

Seems to have lots of regulars by the way staff speaks to their customers. This location is consistently busy....all the time! But the line goes by pretty fast and the accuracy of the coffees are always right. It's nice to shop and drink a Starbucks.  I would not recommend this location for meeting with friends or business because it's fairly loud and never any seats available. But that's what happens when you go to a good Starbucks.

However, I am only going with three stars due to limited BBQ meat selection compared to the others in town, limited cramped parking, and dirty paper menus."

First of all: set your expectations right. AZ Charlie is a dive casino on Decatur. For $13, the 12oz prime rib was probably 85% as good as Lawry's. The sides were standard diner fare, so don't get your hopes up on that. Negatives: be prepared to smell like an ashtray coming out of this place."

It was enough food to provide us another meal. I really appreciated that the meats were fresh, had their own flavor, and were not overly salty. Food highlights/must haves: kimchi and bibimbap.   Staff here are super nice and accommodating!"

Nearly impossible to get a reservation bc it's the cool place to go.. the food and drinks are good (especially the octopus taco) but I can't fathom the prices. I'm just not a fan of the pretentious restaurants in the city especially because there's so many good places that don't have this vibe. Go to Bakersfield instead.

I really appreciated the sun-proof window shade. Good stuff.

They don't overbook their stylists so they concentrate on only one customer at a time. I've never had to wait around for my stylist. The stylists there pay close attention to detail and I always leave satisfied.   However the store is very small and a little bit cramped and they do have a 15 dollar minimum for the card machine.

I sat at the bar, since I dropped in by myself, and all three bartenders were nice and asked several times if I needed anything and if everything was okay.   Tuesdays at Bar Louie are a must."

Food was fine, but there's lots of fine food around; waiting 25 minutes to pay your bill, or 15 minutes to get your water refilled is not a model for a successful restaurant. There seemed to be only one waiter in the entire restaurant for lunch. There was another maybe manager, who was more content to sit down with her laptop and walk around than see how the customers were doing."

They we're very nice and they carefully got all my furniture in the house and set a lot of it up too. I really appreciated when they brought my fridge and treadmill in my house and had to be very creative yet careful when moving these large objects in tight spots. Best of all their rate was far and away the cheapest I found. Would definitely recommend these guys."

It's a pretty solid lunch joint: the centerpiece is the pizza buffet, although both times I've gone, I've ordered salads.  Their salads are atypically good for an establishment like this: there's actually more to them than iceberg lettuce and ranch.  However, I am only giving Rudino's two stars because they are pricey (which, admittedly, is fairly typical for that part of town) and the service is on the slow side."

Some of the chicken pieces that we got you could tell the chicken came from an old chicken.  Seriously! You know when you get a young fresh chicken as opposed to a chicken that was up in age.  Also the fries were over crispy bordering on burnt. So no more cravings for Church's chicken. Craving has been satisfied.

They also have pre-paid cards which get you an additional discount as well. We cone here on average 2x/month.

Carnitas and barbecoa is absolutely delicious, haven't tried other mains because I'm still stuck on those two!   The manager and staff are also always super courteous and welcoming as well.  Always a wonderful experience."

So terrible, we tried to bring one of our friends to try pho for the first time and the service was terrible, we ordered a Thai tea Boba, the Boba was hard and the tea was too strong. It was so gross we didn't pay for it and we're not allowed back but I don't even care, I'm never gonna go back. It was just a waste of time. Don't go here, go up the street to pho Kim long they're pho is way better and cheaper."
AD-MypRxdHpgbLMIRj28dg,9MnbQg7kfb_WgxoV0hXKSQ,2.0,Went back after four years of boycotting due to hair in lemonade. Skipped the drink and got a sandwich to go w  fries. Tipped 20 percent for takeout order. Get back to office- they didn't give me my sauce or ketchup for fries. So check your meal before you leave the joint.

It was busy on a friday night, and the bartenders were pretty efficient.  The drinks were decent, but I did not order anything difficult to make.  It was a little too crowded for my taste.   I might go there again for drinks, but not for food."
hqfyxBqRTNZlZKWfqweaDg,UByM7N0mF-ylIGUuIWHCtA,5.0,"Our server, Lauren, was awesome.  She had great recommendations for beverages and dinner.  We were there celebrating our anniversary and had a great time.  We had the Filet feature with mac and cheese, creamed cheese (a must order!), gnocchi and mushrooms (there were too many great sides to choose from!).  We have eaten here many times and it has never disappointed.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!  They brought us a complimentary dessert since we were celebrating.  Can't wait to go back again!"
b04v2r8jaHlKTsPaZJ8exg,iPWlBvIjyr9-xg_WbL-Z1Q,4.0,I came here with a friend around 1:45 on a Thursday and we were in and out in less than 45 minutes. Line at the entrance went really quick. Our number was G595 and it was at G565 when we got there. We just passed the time on our phones and I would glance up at the TV from time to time. Something about eating lion fish? I don't know. Clean location. Security guard told an old lady she wasn't allowed to vape inside the premises.

0iQZe0WK_7YvtNFOt91dXg,LAKs5UatFvOhlaF4sZ1obA,2.0,Service was good. Pho broth was bland. Price is above average compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area. They have a special vegetarian section on the menu. This joint is a one and done for me.

I've been searching for a lil spot like this for a while now! They have a great selection of fresh meat (btw the butchers are super friendly and informative), fresh cheeses and check this out, they also sell raspados! And everybody knows that if you're spending anytime in phx (let alone a summer) then a good raspado is definitely in need! :)"
XKvbfNylF6Yq8hpwqaZrhA,XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg,3.0,I wish I could give Mesa Grill 3.5 stars but because I'm a fan of Bobby Flay I rounded up.  The pork tenderloin was truly amazing. The side of corn bread was dry. The bread basket was served cold and a bit dry. Nothing too creative just  white bread with minced jalapenos in it.  The service was disappointing. It was rushed and impersonal. Kind of like a diner. I was expecting much better for a restaurant of this caliber.  I decided to round down. Sorry Bobby.

When I went there to meet with Dennis, I was blown away at how clean it was!  I was worried about using genuine BMW parts and he explained the entire process to me and addressed any concern i may have had. Dennis was fantastic, keeping me in the loop throughout the entire repair.  I just got my car back and it looks like new.  I'm thrilled with the quality and service and highly recommend Dennis at Ultimate Collision Repair on Pyle Road."

What i got: peach tart... peaches yummie & lightly glazed, not overly sweet... crust too hard to eat with plastic fork; cafe au'lait was perfect in every way! Pricepoint:  $8.50 for the two items"
Lc5m_fQo6E4BHP9joJLldQ,Mrqk1ydkvgKtlxrExCv6gQ,2.0,"Went here during the Monday $15/dozen special. Oysters were good however each oyster had tiny shell fragments inside. Whoever shucked the oysters probably rushed them since we only waited a few minutes to receive an order of two dozen oysters.  I would have given this place four stars, but after eating each oyster my friend and I spent a few seconds picking pieces of shells out of our mouths."
yR102wNG6ZP7UHuvkwbsAg,yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ,4.0,"Four stars. There were so many people and we waited for a long time. All of us were very hungry but what we can do is wait...

We started off with the tapas sampler, and everything on it was great.  We also ordered bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, which just melted in my mouth.  For our entree, we shared a fried chicken dish--very good and actually not too heavy.  And if course, since it's a Cuban restaurant, I had mojitos.  They were delicious, and very authentic--no Bacardi!  In addition to the great food, the service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be going back soon!"
LQDMhRTov_Tw8AwH4gtbDw,Z4BLvKJuJOpiaWGW8X62sg,3.0,"Visited here on Sunday. It is very simple, breakfast with little pizzazz.  It was very unflavorful. I ordered Eggs scrambled, Sausage Links, and ""Cheese Grits"". (Cheese Grits to them means a sliver of fake American cheese is a type of processed cheese -- you know the type from the cellophane wrapper)  -- placed on top. YUCK.  Hands down one of the biggest disappointments for a breakfast place in Charlotte. Especially near Stonecrest. Parking is awful (near Trader Joe's).  Staff was friendly but I would Pass this one up with all the better options in the area ........"
t9ccmZlg1VYV2LTFII8yQA,5I8VE_KBcDhh6uzdt5hwTg,5.0,I had a special request for a royal blue and gold baby shower cake.

Vanilla cake with vanilla bean Bavarian cream with fresh strawberries.
t7RX98ihV9bQdV01NdjUDQ,BFibmswPtBNyChp8vBHRsg,5.0,"When you first walk in it will trip you out! Very elegant and classy inside. Good luck finding good seating. This place is huge, but almost always packed. Pastries are a total delight! I would come here just for a pastry treat and pass on the coffee. Probably one of the most enchanting coffee shops I've ever been in. A fantastic place to bring a close friend or relative for a long conversation."
TlSKUk9Jz-AY_gq5DTOZAg,SGbQkUmgFHSWL6TLraMxrA,5.0,I highly recommend the mini crowns! I've been enjoying them for years and they make a nice treat when visiting someone!  The bigger crowns are also good however the mini ones have a better dough to filling ratio.
F4i0ihFyolIG1OE65xCQoQ,yNBVOKSZN_AIjSJdhF_rqA,5.0,"Really great 'fast' food - healthy and quick but everything was just SO flavorful! I got a veggie wrap and the flavors of everything worked so well - hummus, pickles, cabbage, rice, lettuce - the tahini dressing was amazing and the Greek vinaigrette finished it off nicely! I almost went back for another one! My husband got the steak wrap with hummus, lettuce, tabbouleh, tzatziki, and rice and he said he was really good as well. We also got the season chips which were great as well.   This place is basically a Mediterranean Chipotle"

2nLFJTy7R55T54Fyrv81eg,iecSIYDAYs-9zmdJFh12OQ,1.0,What is wrong with this place? Seems like it creates a uproar in the kitchen just ordering a cheesburger (which I never got). I'll never go there again.
IdCCl2b3BwenUgxGdUQhhQ,2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA,5.0,Yum... Need I say more! Normally my wife and I split a meal but at Haji Baba we don't because it's more fun to share! Not the typical type of food found in the valley a real hidden gem. What it lacks in the decor and atmosphere it makes up for in flavor and price... I highly recommend this place!
8NMeJBvF-1BiBxJJGm_0Iw,cth3pA7Mj_v2Ka9GeOd0Ng,5.0,"This was a wonderful experience! We rode public transportation to get close to the track, then walked a little ways to get there. Great view of the strip from here!  I used to work at a go-kart place in Pigeon Forge, TN, but these are definitely the fastest go-karts I've ever driven! What a thrill-ride!  We had a Groupon, and everyone we met was friendly and helpful. This is a highly recommended attraction!!!"

VhyyvAfI9nYg2mVGuZ6Aaw,1YC7AbQMlNb5mLUlwwaa3w,3.0,"Pizza here is phenomenal.  Other than that, food is average (sandwiches, salads, etc.).  Tap list is pretty good too.  It is ok for watching a game in that you can usually find a table or seat at the bar, though I would rather go to Mario's if I am staying around Shadyside.  Service is average."
TKFIO3b2vUxWuMOOSSQBLA,gxfvv12xZo81YcndEusSLQ,5.0,A smoking oasis located far from the traffic and noise of the strip! Top notch humidor with a well rounded selection and fair pricing. Nicely decorated interior with leather and wood. The best part? OPEN LATE......

Now, this is  good dim sum, I know it because I'm chinese :) The dim sum here are very tranditional and nicely done. Hg and sm is nicely done. The only complain, no early bird discount."

I loved it . I brought my family back for some to try as well !! Thank you
umVLP0GIF2hwTXbNQvEvDg,fiRbomFAAtfTYOTTtnDUcA,1.0,"Ordered from Caliente on a weeknight, and it took an hour and a half to get the pizza.  When we finally got the pizza it was cold.  I was hopeful that after waiting so long the pizza would be worth the wait but was left disappointed.  The toppings were decent but the dough tasted just like the big chains.    Bottom line - if you want a passable pizza delivered ice cold in two hours this is your place, otherwise you are better off going somewhere else."
r_Yy46ieBZU6APX0YZR4sQ,8XVAcOZ02IGTQE-pvKhXXw,5.0,Discovered this gem by pure luck!!! Smart name and absolutely fantastic latte. The choices of spice to mix are great. The smell when u enter this place is exquisite and puts you in the mood immediately. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Would go there everyday if I lived nearby!!
Qh4s4cirOrG8MdaIbH6Udw,7ULRdJfVo2-Og5ZoGOECFg,1.0,Service was unbelievably slow. There was one other table in the restaurant and it took over a half hour to get out me food and took the server over ten min to come to the table for drinks. The good is not worth the price either. $40 for a small salmon and chicken skewers that weren't done well enough. Won't be going back.
sRu5hgpkoIoRS9Ost8PuIw,vYKZHWBuBT1PUevggLAE9w,5.0,"Made an appt. for the Genius Bar online, showed up and waited 5 minutes. That's it!

Priced are jacked up, no more lunch specials and the food quality, my rolls tasted bland and fell apart... Does anyone know if the old owners opened a sushi place up I'll follow them. The customer service here was great for us,  except the short haired blonde lady,  she had an attitude problem. The food not worth it."
3IZz2vYLTbmh6V3DwUFIXQ,tWiFat101ID5w_wgAPMXhA,5.0,"If you're a college student living near ASU, this place is a go-to spot. The wait is a bit long at times, but it's pretty much worth it. My favorite has got to be the polish with ketchup, onions, tomatoes, bacon, sauerkraut, and some of their hot sauce. What's awesome about this place is the fact that you can put mac and cheese on your hot dog too + you get to see the staff cook it for you on their charcoal grill.  Overall: Service - 5 Food - 5 Wait time - 3~4 Cleanliness - 4"

Not only have they never gotten my order right, but the last time my food was spiked with cayenne (which I am allergic too). I had to have an epinephrine shot and still broke out in hives and stopped breathing. If you value your health, please never eat from here"
YDAL4CBJcp3xrYgAGVGgaQ,htiB-auOhxa6YTp9bAb6lw,4.0,Had the Sausage Penne. Was very good. Had enough meat which a lot of these places like to skip out on so I was impressed.

MoozvJxx-3xG7B9fvmP3Vw,XZbuPXdyA0ZtTu3AzqtQhg,4.0,Loved this place. Is beautiful and fun. I like a lot the decor. Service is very attentive. Even when we went on another night for a soda when almost were closed. The food is very very good! We didn't wait for a table because we had reservations.  I think you should go well dressed.

QSfk1gGGcW-d2K5d0HWS1w,LJbLYYvSe6Dy9qN1dMiwGw,2.0,I ordered a lap top battery from the site and you got a 10% discount to pick up in store. Then I get a call. They don't have the battery and need to look for it. Then I get a call the battery is nowhere in the universe for some reason and they offered my money back. My question is WHY IN THE HELL DO YOU OFFER IT ON THE SITE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BATTERY? What a waste of time.

I have traveled to Latin america several times and the dishes they served felt completely authentic. I particularly loved the plantains as an appetizer, the specialty mojitos, and flan for desert.   Great experience all around!"

This was one of the cheapest places we could find and the location is PERFECT center strip.  The outdoor pool area isn't super fancy but it's nice and wasn't insanely crowded.  The rooms are average size but very classy with pink & black decor and black hardwood floors. It was a really fun place to hang out.  I would definitely stay here again!"

I decided to shop around and realized that Aloha on a bad day is pretty much better than other salons on a good day so I went back. The 3 stars is because they are great if you go during a non-busy time but the quality still drops when they get busy.

I got 3 sets of 2nd hand snow suits for only $15 each on kijiji and 1 set included some really good snow boots. If you want an actual store to buy from instead of kijiji, Prices are better at Goodwill, salvation army or value village."

All food options (pho, com, bun) are excellent and flavourful and fast. Two people can get stuffed for under 20 bucks.  If you come not expecting impeccable service but simple tasty food at a great price you'll be a happy camper.  Rule of thumb when it comes to viet food: good if owner is viet, mediocre if owner is chinese-viet, and run away if owner is hongkongnese. And stay well west of yonge."

No meal at Dressler's would be complete without the homemade peanut butter cheesecake!   Met Live takes place right outside the restaurant on Thursday's & Saturday's!"

We asked another waitress after 20 minutes . We finally got water and then our drinks . The food was ok- but the service by far made it to where I won't go back"

The fries was perfectly seasoned and crispy. They also sell local beer there which was an extra plus. Kind of on the expensive side for a burger and Noda beer it costed me almost $18 bucks."

Sandwiches wrapped in plastic makes rolls rubbery as well as making the sandwich soggy when the sandwich has mayo, mustard, tomatoes etc. anything with liquid (if not eaten right away). I hope they change this to a paper wrap because the ham was good but by the time I got to eat my sandwich it was rubbery and soggy."

I loved that I could really taste the lemon.  If you are a fan of pasta I highly recommend PastaBAR but don't expect the typical Olive Garden style pastas.

She was attentive and answered all our questions. Our only note would be to reconsider the music. We wish it had been a bit more subtle in the background."
cD4sHHO5sEljk7qSGhVaEw,W1pj7OeYz5oF42vACSoxmA,4.0,Somehow this one has the best food.  Staff: friendly as usual. This is one of the few that the staff upsold to me on pies and I appreciate them taking their job seriously.  Food: it is the same food but it seems like they put more care into it so they seem to have the right amount of ingredients in every sandwich. I will say they seem to only have apple pies and no other options (other places have at least 2 flavours in my experience)  Overall one of the best locations I've been to

I came here for happy hour which is from 4 to 7. They offer margaritas and beers at happy hour prices. Half off appetizers.  The food was decent. Nothing particularly special. Our server Christian was really sweet and attentive so its hard to give this place a lower rating.

I've had better luck with finding fresher fruit and veggies here than I do at Loblaws, where things tend to be older and more expensive. They have a great selection of produce, stock Asian cooking essentials, and have very reasonable prices. The staff aren't particularly talkative, but are friendly and helpful.

He lacked the people skills it takes to be anyones boss. Other than him, I love the el cortex"

This store might not be as big as the ones in Beachwood or the one in Westfield's South Park Mall.

On top of that, chicken was undercooked. Basically pink inside and the skin under the batter was still very raw and gooey. Kind of disgusting. There was close to no syrup as well. The eggs benny was another disappointment. You'd expect a nice runny poached egg but these yolks were hard. It seemed like the chef didn't put much effort into the cooking."

As I was checking out I noticed that the shelf above the games held all kinds of old game consoles (it almost was like a museum honoring past gaming machines).

This is actually a big chain in the U.S that just opened first store in Canada. There is Italian ice, milkshakes, frozen custard and more. We tried the gelati with the mango italian ice and vanilla frozen custard. It was sooooo refreshing and mango flavour was delicious as real fruits are used. The frozen custard is like a soft serve ice cream but with a more rich taste. Overall, good value for what we were getting!"

Yes, but for folks that don't want to get a fish stick. Don't come here unless you want the chicken strips. I wanted fish. If you see the photos on any of the reviews of the fish, that's what you'll get. One poster said it reminded him of the frozen fish sticks that his mom used to make.  If you want chicken strips, then you'll love theirs."

She is a long haired kitty and her fur gets knotted up and dreadlocked. We get her grooming taken care of here. It reminded me of when I worked for the Cuyahoga County and had to take unpaid days off as a cost saving measure for their budget. Why you ask? Because we get her fur low (furlough). They really do take care of the animals here.

PR4WdsVokM9-6jAMGJatgg,rcaPajgKOJC2vo_l3xa42A,5.0,Just amazing. Ate here twice since it was so good. The bone marrow appetizer was basically the best thing I ate. The sauce was so amazing and it did not go to waste with the fresh baked bread on the table. The cheese selection was amazing.

Given its proximity to PenMac, its tiny cheese section felt embarrassingly pathetic. Its price doesn't seem to be competitve either.  Data point from Feb. 2009: its half gallon organic milk was actually $1 more than the same product at Whole Foods. The store still seems to be setting up -- spacious to the point of feeling desolate."

Super expensive given the very small portions and few ingredients.  The service was slow and unattentive. Saw our waitress only twice. The hostess texted that our table was ready but had no idea what table it was and kept us waiting at the counter another 10 minutes to figure it out.   The drinks were good. I liked the pink drink."

There's people standing everywhere and it takes about 2hrs with an appointment to see a doctor. They mix the walk ins with ppl with apmt so what's the point of making an appointment when you are not first priority ? Please get it together here. You should seperate the walkins and give people with appointments the attention they deserve without these outrageous wait times. The worst part is after I waited 2hrs I saw a tech not even a dr!

While our server was very nice, the man we paid at the front counter was rude, practically tossing our change on the counter. I was very surprised to experience such a low level of customer service in Toronto which in my opinion is known for its high standard of customer service. Food-wise, the bacon seemed pre-cooked and re-heated because it was the hardest bacon I've ever had. Toronto has WAY too many restaurants cooking great food that would value your business.

It said the lunch special came with fries, but they didn't charge me to switch it out, which was nice.   The pita was great-- fresh pita, moist chicken, perfect amount of sauce. The hummus was also very good and you get a ton of it, along with pita bread. Unfortunately, although I like it, the chipotle flavor didn't go with the chicken souvlaki. I think next time I would sub a salad."

The only saving grace, for me, was the cranberry-pomegranate (or something similar) iced tea, which wasn't too sweet (yay!) and very refreshing (~$3).    Other important info: chain restaurant, country store and rocking chairs were fun, overwhelming menu, cleaning could be improved, and slow service."

If its afternoon go elsewhere, they aren't worth the trip considering how inconsistent their hours are."

I have a few email requests that I am going to submit, so I will update this review with their responsiveness in mind."

Any type of equipment that you need for lifting to cardio is there and is all new and in running order. Everyone there is very friendly and you'd be hard-pressed to find a better place to work out.

Server was surprised there was such a  thing as a ""red zinfandel"" so obviously the pairing question was a bad one.   Appetizers were OK, We enjoyed the ambiance, place was dead for  Saturday night.  left most of the food on our plates, left a small tip and went home."

I had two rings re-sized here and they gave me a very reasonable price. Frankie was great and took really good care of me and my wife's rings. Great place!

The guac is 'you need a fork because your chip is going to break its so chunky' good. I had the veggie enchiladas which I highly recommend. The only reason this place gets a 4/5 is because I only got two enchiladas and another time I got three."

Came in a few years back for a conference, and we brought family there for the Star Trek adventure.  Today, the place is quiet, no one is up yet and the casino floor is empty.    For a small price, we can ride the rail, stop and get off when you want and then get back on.  Parking is free at the Hilton, so the cost of the rail is all you'll be out.  Then you can beat the traffic jams at the major properties with limited access."

We ordered the Curry Squash with tofu, one of their soups, Moak Gai, and one of their fried rice dishes. We didn't really care for the Moak Gai as it didn't seem to have much flavor. The soup and fried rice where very good and worth ordering again, but it was the Curry Squash that left us wanting more. What a great little place. Note this place is not large, but they seem to handle it very well."

Make sure you ask for the white cheese dip with the chips to start, amazing!   The rest of the food was delicious, the Margaritas were strong and massive, and the service was great.   The only reason I took away a star was because we made a reservation and then had to still wait at the bar for about a half hour before being seated."

We have never lived in an apartment this long, but just signed our second lease with them. We live in a renovated apartment, and love it. The renovations are certainly economical, but you learn to expect that in multi-family housing. We love the location of our apartment, and all our neighbors are friendly.

Offered free oil change on my next visit. Very much appreciated and I will be giving them another try.  Thank you Andrew"

Easy to get stuck in the drive through and not be able to get out if it's taking too long. Have been late to work more than once because of this. But all in all a good location.

I had to order the Sandia Loca after seeing the picture and am so glad I did. The orders do take 10-15 min to make since its all fresh but that wasn't a problem at all."

This place is ok, not where I would come to for an authentic Thai meal but it is palletable (you can still eat it). I normally always get the Pad Thai because I like the taste and with the right amount of spice any Pad Thai can be good!   As far as food courts go, they are no better than any of the other choices but it a nice alternative to burgers and French fries."

Overall good value though."

It is usually surrounded by people smoking outside the door so I am never sure if they are actually busy or if it is just a smoker's hangout.  They often have live bands or something like it. The music is generally terrible but it a pleasant surprise when the band is tolerable.   While I've not known it to get rowdy, it usually geys pretty loud- mainly the music."

They don't try to pile on fancy, expensive ingredients- just give you a delicious, simple burger that is exactly what I crave. Their burgers have a unique taste with the brown sugar added which is a hard thing to achieve with burgers. VERY cheap, perfect for a quick meal and affordable to everyone. Their fried zucchini, mushrooms, and teasers are great appetizers or snacks. Customizable burgers. Extremely quick service and attentive servers."

The renovations to the place are really nice as well. They made my favorite place to get my nails and toes done even better and now I can add eyebrows to the mix. They always do a fantastic job and I never have a complaint.

A tasty spicy chicken stock with noodles, chicken, shrimp, shrimp wontons, and some chopped up scallions. Simple, but on the spot. To me, the soups on Tin Tin's menu are the gems, the rest is mediocre.  Their hibachi is a little hit or miss, a lot of times overcooked or over seasoned. Getting a mouthful of soy sauce flavor is not pleasant."

Over worked and underpaid I would guess."

Sambhar was a bit thick for my liking, the chutneys were good, so overall all flavours were a good blend. Made the mistake of doing take-out, so the food was a bit soggy by the time I got to it.

My husband and I are going out for lunch and dinner during the weekends and are always looking for local places to eat.  Today we felt like burgers so we decided to visit Harvey's. We shared the big burger & fries and it was not bad at all.  After dinner I asked him if he'd come back and he surprisingly said yes (he's a picky eater). He said he would have rated Harvey's 4.5 but that he wasn't pleased the cook was the server and the bartender.

We hopped off I-80 from PA to MI and definitely worth the trip. The setting and community of Hudson is quaint and pleasant. Enjoy!"

But if you go during off hours (in our case, Superbowl Sunday - hey... no Cards... no point in watching), the crowds are minimal and the grounds are very peaceful, which makes it nice to enjoy the food and the mild February weather."

I took my 2008 Infiniti through like I have a million times. When I was through and started drying off my car, I noticed that the trunk molding had been knocked off. I know they aren't responsible for things like that happening, but when I asked the guy running the car wash to get it for me, it was like I was putting him out! Not a sign of human kindness at all!"

The price was great for what we received.  We will be back when we are in the area.    This place has a lot going for it.  The atmosphere inside is nice and it is like stepping away from the busy area just outside its doors.  It was clean and comfortable and very relaxing.  The service was great and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu.

N2PKe8gVA-JT0HyUtF-IfA,8gglUd7sWgOL7Pd-IK3QCQ,1.0,This hole in the wall should have its license suspended. What kind of people let their customers drink themselves to oblivion? They obviously do not care about anything but their bottom line. Is it going to take a mugging or murder to convince them to not serve people who come in drunk or cut them off when they get plastered in this place? Demolition is my recommendation

They have a nice, tranquil place in a neighborhood in North Scottsdale.  Intake is quick through a window.  You fill out some information and they take over care of the animal.  They rehabilitate and release back into the wild.  They gladly accept donations, which I was so happy to do since they were taking over the care of these sweet, injured creatures for me.  These folks are the best!"

Thought it was odd that I received this first because I also ordered the ""crazy angel"" roll......WOW, if you like sushi, this one is outstanding. Long time sushi rock fan.....nobly tei is better in my opinion. Girlfriend  ordered the salmon bento box which is a fancy version of a tradinional takeout combo. Good food and hibachi or dining is available."

Was still really good! Definitely coming back here"

Definitely recommend the Bombay chicken and the green curry. The green curry was so flavourful. It was, dare I say it, even comparable to high end Thai restaurants like Pai but for fraction of the cost! The owner served us and he was super nice and accommodating. If you're not from around here, lock your cars cause the plaza ain't no gated community."

I don't know what it's like during the day, but at night its the best time to shop. Not much people.   I usually buy some produce here but remember to check the date.   The only thing I dislike is if you really wanted to find something or wanted expertise on something.

I guess they can really jack up the price cause it's vegas and people will pretty much pay no matter how expensive things are.

You'll sweat a ton and feel defeated but it'll be worth it with those quads you'll acquire.  Unlike other barre classes there's a greater focus on strengthening and endurance vs. cardio. Who needs cardio ;) Weights are used so you can choose how difficult you want it to be.  Just wish the classes had some more variation with the playlist / choreography.  I can probably list the songs to each segment of the class.   Ps. There's also student discount.

The service was super good and the eggs and potatoes were yummy. I liked the lightly grilled tomato slice.  It was a very cheery place to spend a Sunday morning catching up with a friend. The music was a bit bouncy so if you need a mellower mood, be forewarned.  They were making beautiful-looking, boozy breakfast drinks at the bar but I had errands and chores so stuck to coffee - an excellent americano. Next time :)"

Most of the staff signing out doctorate degrees are signed by faculty with MBAs.

It's frozen with whipped cream on top, unlike some of the other casinos on the Strip that serve it as a shaken drink (and that's if they have strawberry flavoring at all. Whaaa?). The flamingos, parrots, and fish out back of the hotel all add to the experience. You can take pictures of all the animals and pay a small fee to hold the parrots. All in all, I really enjoyed Flamingo and I'll be back!"

Do people not want to work anymore. 6 girls standing around hostess stand while customers what 46 min for a seat because the kitchen is backed up. Get rolls. Get drinks. Bus tables. Do something.

The good - drinks specials - central location to financjal district - dead so you'll get a seat  The bad -washrooms are not the nicest - crowd is so so - Food looked only ok - drinks cheap but wine but pricy -overall place uppity for what it was  Won't be back 100$ for a few drinks? No thanks!

They don't accept credit cards and only accept cash, which is understandable for being a small business. They aren't as friendly as I would like and customer service isn't out of this world (it's not bad, just not great), but I think it's just because they may be understaffed and overworked. The grooming they do on my Zoe makes up for it!"

We got in and staff was not overly friendly. In the room the hardwood floor was nice but our shower leaked all night and the walls were dingy.

Good portion size for a single diner, but very bland and not spicy at all -- which is unfortunate because that's why I ordered it. Egg roll also very underwhelming filling-wise. Also the food was lukewarm.   Was a takeout order, ready when I arrived. Dropped my chopsticks walking to the door and the staff woman ran me another pair. She also made sure I was carrying the bag so it was upright.  Good service, underwhelming food."

The technology exist today that this should never happen.  South Point doesn't care and neither does Vegas.com... All they want is your money.  This is my last stay at this hotel and we will never use vegas.com again.

Stopped by here a couple months ago and they moved to the top of the list.  Also has a convenient drive thru.

The Belgian chocolate is my favorite but it's also fun to try the unique flavors they have especially at holidays (St Patrick's day had some fun ones). Prices are your typical pricey ice cream rates.

I don't usually come to Oregano's unless I know I am getting a hot cookie for dessert. My favorite is the chocolate chip which comes with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream on top. Best to share with a friend is it is rather large."

Came with a thin side of burnt to a crisp barely edible hash browns. I dont know how you could make that meal bland but they did it. I had their buscuit special with eggs. The eggs were dry and taste like they were going bad. The biscuits were served cold and again, everything was bland. Its not the worst resturant, but I wont consider coming back. There are much better places out there."

It's a comfort to see an establishment like this still exist, maintain reasonable prices and still deliver a quality product. Really, the hot dogs and burgers here are amazing and they make them right in front of you. Don't be shy - tell them how you want them cooked!    This is your grill and it has been for decades.

I was unable to get a wax before I left for Las Vegas, so I used Yelp to help find a place here. The places on the strip are ridiculous and thankfully I had a car and could drive off strip.   I was not at all disappointed with Sarah. She was friendly, quick, and efficient. If I lived here, I would go to her regularly. It was definitely one of the best brazilian waxes I've ever experienced."

But the manager/owner  was yelling at employees in front of customers. Our food ended up being cold. It was also not fast. And I didn't think the price was worth the product. The udon at all you can eat sushi places taste better. The broth was bland... They told us to come back. I'll wait a while maybe it'll be better. We ended up spending almost 50$ on 3 people. That's a decent meal somewhere else.

But this is good, quality pizza. tasteful and quite convenient if you are at the Aria.   For a quick bite, it gets the job done. You won't be disappointed, especially if you are already inside the Aria. the slices are large and you can get your pizza and pay in about two minutes."

I'm not much an italian-food lover but this place has changed my mind. I ordered the duck - and it was absolutely amazing! Our waiter was fantastic - helped guide us to some of his favorites while explaining some wine pairings. The ambiance was warm, inviting, and still intimate. I will definitely be back here."

The restrooms were immaculate clean and the fish tacos were amazing. However, the best part of this establishment was our bartender. Pat, on the graveyard shift, was very welcoming. Seemed like an old friend within minutes. Professional, attentive, and just fun. Because of Pat, our trip inside went from a couple of drinks and dinner to an epic all night event.

Most of the ""meat"" dishes are made from tofu, which I love to eat, but not when it's made to look like something it is not.  At first, the taste isn't too bad, but after a few bites, you realize you are not eating meat, the texture is just not there and neither is the taste.  Well, I gave it a shot, but no way could i enjoy eating this type of food consistently."

I had a sausage pizza for 11$ which was a good size and cooked somewhere in between thin crust and doughy. They've got some lunch specials and salads that looked alright, although the salmon filet looked to be a frozen cut.   Service was adequate.   Is Baldwin street actually good?"

It's good to see a restaurant that can focus on the food as much as it focus's on it's ambiance.  It's probably a good thing that it's not on the canal because I feel those restaurants simply charge a high price to make you feel like you are getting something exclusive but in reality you are getting an average meal.  With the exception of Olive and Ivy which is great for the patio.  Regardless we will keep coming back to Cowboy Ciao."

Spicy, intense flavors - definitely not recommended for a picky eater. I was with two friends who shared a lamb and chicken platter and some sambusas which they loved.

It is immaculately clean and there is no smell of acetone like some other nail salons. I had a pedicure and reflexology massage on this trip and it was wonderful! So relaxing I fell asleep during the reflexology massage. $60 for the treatment and I came out feeling energized and my feet and skin look and feel wonderful. I will definitely come back and try a manicure.

That being said everything pales in comparison to their nachos...seriously...they are the best nachos I've ever had!  Their drinks are out of this world (which was expected since they're a Merchant step-sister) and the lounge in the basement is a MUST for after dinner socializing (tip: order the Mexican Firing Squad)!

Kevin was very professional and you could tell that he had a lot of knowledge and experience. His massage was amazing, and he knew what specific areas to work on based on my occupation. He also took his time, so it didn't feel rushed or like he was counting the minutes. I will definitely go back to this place and recommend it to others!"

KUnI4jr08H912dMgVvstjQ,aY-lZvoTHAFl9k6dcfcAxQ,2.0,Where do I start? We have been here many many times. We continue to hold out hope for this place because when the stars align you might get a tasty lunch at a very reasonable price.  The lunches are 6 to 8 dollars with the usual soup/salad and egg roll with it. Portions are small but adequate. Various sauces do well to hide the taste of these fresh from the freezer offerings.  Just 2 miles from Sun Lakes across from the Fry's Market. Come as you are. Teeth are optional.

They are only four stars, however, because my manicurist could have been gentler. My cuticles were a little sore afterwards!  Services were overall great though.

I do feel their coke product prices are high unless coke has just gone up but I've gotten Powerade as 2 for $1.50? before at Terrible's or Rebel and it was more expensive here but with it being across the street from my work can't complain too much.

However, the service we received while dining at the bar was so mediocre that the excellence of food couldn't even save the experience. The bartender helping us seemed like he had no use of his own brain. One mistake after another, and in place of recovery we received a couple of insults. This won't stop us from dining at other tk locations. Writing this review and hoping that management will read it and do something about it."

It took less than 10 minutes. Everyone is friendly and willing to help. It's a little crowded because they have so many for sale cars but that's the only downside. Visit their website for the coupon because it will save you $6 dollars. I'll be back again next year!"
1iO70fabuVpCYcOXVq1Ejg,TShoU62Hm-4wH2EzwkJbrg,4.0,"Pretty good - a nice option for pho in the north Scottsdale area.  It's in a nondescript strip mall that's easy to miss.  In addition to the pho, which was quality stuff, I gave the shaken beef a try - a bit oily, but overall tasty.  They've got a whole menu chocked full of rice dishes and I'll likely go back and try some more."
yS1kK5EGcwatp6D6hFGvlw,-FtngCwHCD2tRlH8jpj_Ag,2.0,"Okay, I've eaten here a number of times, and can truly say that I am un-impressed.  Once you get over the hype/ theme of the restaurant, you will quickly come to learn that the food here can be easily made at home.   Now here is my criticism : 1. The food lacked flavor  2. The price for just a single pancake ($7.99) is outrageous  3. The food is never hot 4. The coffee is always closed  5. The only free refillable drink here is water  Overall,  my brother enjoys this place but I can definitely miss this."

Then the whole time they were chatting while cutting my hair right next to me. The hairstylist was in a rush to get me out, did a poor job in styling my hair. No hairspray or anything extra, only blowed dried. I could of done a better job myself."
XrBvB0d_QuuCf8nHeytW4w,xmARZ_MuSfrQCXP4e8RQjg,5.0,"Still an excellent experience! I had not been there in a while, but I was on my way home and decided to stop for take-out. I ordered a house salad with chicken. The large portion easily fed two, the chicken was moist and well seasoned, and the house salad dressing is a Thousand Island-y sort of thing that is really good. I'll have to get back soon to re-try the pizza.  It is good to see places that maintain their quality standards over time."
STyj851OOHR0CYr_NWnaKg,wTRnf52iB-vAjwVZhRlGEQ,5.0,An incredible beer selection and great pub food.  The Friday fish is very good.  Also a good atmosphere to enjoy some time with friends.

Now for those who enjoy a good lunch: the portions are generous, the daily specials always are and they put ice in the mens room. This place also happens to be hidden in the coolest strip mall in all of Arizona. If you can't find it, you don't belong there."
htzxDWzRt4Xd7UGy4t0yAw,Gepo-V2cjV-BA3oNde2tDw,3.0,"Very cute place. New and fresh so it doesn't have the sticky diner feel. Cheap eats. The high point to me was the pancake. Real flapjacks, kinda chewy and a little crisp on the edges. Soaked up the syrup just right. But the low point was the coffee. I don't say this lightly: the coffee was BAD. Not ""sitting on the burner too long"", it was fresh, but it was bad. I've had better instant coffee. If the pancakes weren't so good and the prices so low, this would be two stars."

Hidden away off a side street in Mile Ex, Manitoba mixes a beautiful setting with incredible food at a reasonable price. All the dishes are inspired by, and use, elements of Quebec nature, giving each dish a unique quality. From local seaweed, crisped and added with raw seal, to perfectly cooked deer with a medley of local mushrooms, the food, ambience and setting was genuinely exquisite. In a city of culinary gems, I could not recommend Manitoba highly enough."

Grilled cheese sandwich was really good, as were the tomato bisque and red pepper lobster soups. Really reasonably priced.  The bad: Caramel brownie looked better than it tasted. My boyfriend's soup had a hair in it. Limited seating. Loud."

Second, the pricing is ridiculous for basically the same thing you can do on your Xbox or play station. I really hope I don't have to come here again, it's so loud, the only reason I'm here is to be the DD. The only good thing is that our server was nice."

The menu has changed quite a bit - this learns more towards Turkish than anything else, and has some interesting options for you meaters. Veg fare hasn't budged, and neither have the prices, but the quality and portion size have improved some. Falafel now comes with a smidge of hummus on the side, which is a nice touch.  Everyone that waited on me was very tall, female, and beautiful, in that awesome Mediterranean way, so there's that."

The patio is partially shaded by trees which makes it bearable with our intense hot weather. We had a yogurt parfait and an oatmeal which were good. I'm a serious latte drinker and it was okay. I gave it four stars for ambiance (especially a place for my kiddo to enjoy) and food. Wish this place was closer to my house!

The slices were enormous, covered in pepperoni and piping hot. I'm normally more of a thick crust fan, but the crispy thin crust here was on point. I scarfed down my two slices, which were probably more like four slices of normal sized pizza, and headed back out the door.   Will definitely be back for another slice, or three."

They serve turkey bacon (one of the best I've had) that is thick and flavorful. Pretty much everything that I've tried has exceeded my expectations for a gluten free meal/treat.   Another awesome part about this place is that you can buy all the gluten free flours premixed and ready to bake with. The gluten free flour mixtures are hard enough to get right on your own. They do it for you and it's cheaper then any grocery store.   Enjoy!

If you go there late there won't be much left. I love baked bbq pork buns. Custard buns are great too, more custard than flours! Love it! Service can be slow on the weekends due to the big crowds."

This fancy ""diner"" matches the rest of the Urban Hip decor of this Casino Hotel.  The food is pretty good here. Service was not too bad. The Waiter was friendly & attentive, but slow....like was the kitchen located at the other end of the Vegas Strip?   The food is pricey, but Hubby used his Reward Card points to pay for the meal...which was almost as much as eating at a BUFFET!!!"

If you're a you're a chili fan. I recommend the chili.

They also have a great selection in dried goods like lentils and beans, halumi cheese, olives, oils...all a bit more exotic and less expensive then an ordinary grocery store. It is simply fun to shop there and get inspired to try something new."

Biscuits were literally hard like a hockey puck. The mashed potatoes had such a small amount of gravy it was almost a joke. Not worth it. Go find yourself a KFC.

It's also very hard to get any service here when you are standing at the pickup counter and not looking into the display cases, looking like a new $ALE. They also NEVER answer their phone.

Beer selection is likely one of the best in Gilbert.   The staff was very friendly and interactive, and are happy to answer any question you have.   The only thing I might suggest, a little bit more of a substantial food menu.  The various twists on grill cheese, while very tasty, would hardly qualify as more than a snack.   Even a snack mix or bowl of nuts would help."

The burger was perfect....slightly sloppy, juicy, big enough where you had to open your mouth a little wider than norm to bite it and on a soft bun. The SmashFries are good too and even better dipped in SmashSauce.  And, if your a stickler about good customer service....you won't be disappointed by the friendly staff here."

Dessert was delicious! I also recommend the peach margarita.   Tip: some of the tables face the hotel sports bar and the tv's take away from the restaurant atmosphere."

Everything was very good and reasonably priced. Service from the two female bartenders was excellent as well.  We'll be back for sure!

Not only were they supercool about getting them for me, they didn't seem offended when I said I was doing my own flowers.

Friday night they have great techno upstairs...it's $5 cover and the alcohol is dirt cheap.  The only thing bad about this place is the lack of carding means there are quite a bit of under-agers, but it's still a good time."

Prices are super reasonable. Unfortunately, food took 24 min, they said the other store had a malfunction and this kitchen was getting ""slammed"".  Got my order wrong.  Second chance order took 16 min, orders are all correct and delicious.  4 stars because of the initial infraction."

Not a single spot was missed, the rooms are very clean, and they always check that it isn't too painful. Sticks and waxing strips change frequently, they go over their work, and are very efficient. The most painful part was trying not to laugh when they did my toes. Definitely coming back again."

They don't give you that condescending look if you ask simple questions that I've found to be pretty common in gun stores. They advertise the lowest prices on the valley and from what I've seen that's true, I chose to buy both of my guns here. If you're looking to purchase a firearm and they have it, they can typically get it to you quickly and at a very reasonable price."

Ed's has a lot of space inside with many TVs and the expansive deck out back is a great place to relax outside.  Ed's is a comfortable, fun place. I definitely recommend that you visit soon."

I also had the wood mocktail, which was terrific - I don't drink alcohol, but sometimes I want a small, non-fizzy, thoughtfully mixed cocktail and this was perfect. Service was attentive.

However, like most nails shops like this they were trying to do too much at once. The gentleman who did my nails had no conversation for me, not sure if it was because he was so busy watching what everyone else was doing or because he was tending to his, approximately, 10 year old son. Either way I'm still on the hunt for a regular salon and would probably only go here in an emergency."

The portions could have been a little bigger.  I ordered the breaded fish tacos and they were very fresh and flavorful.  Could have used more lemon though.  The decor was eclectic and colorful.  The waitress friendly and attentive.  My only quibble is that the meal cost me $15 for the meal and a soda.  A little high, but no regrets.  Tom"

We shared a full 16oz beer as we played old school games, such as Connect 4.  We loved the vive up here and will definitely come back!"

It was nice to be able to relax on a comfy sofa while the kids got their energy out. It's great that they allow in outside food and drink in. My only complaint is that they don't sell anything to snack on or drink. There are water fountains available for the kiddos, though. Pricing is great, too.  Tip: bring socks. Everyone must wear socks, even mom and dad."

They make sure everything is always fresh. A few times I go there and order something that looks less than fresh, and they always take my order, throw out the non-fresh item I just ordered and make it right then. It may take a few moments, but I never have to ask them to make a fresher batch, they can see as well as I can, and I like that."

I got a full set with gel polish and I asked for a glittered finger and they charged 8$ for that. The design didn't come out correctly it's uneven and has spots where there is no glitter. The technicians are unfriendly and not courteous to their customers. I will be going back to my original place.

The service at Lawry's is unmatched which is saying a lot in the hospitality that Vegas offers. The dinner experience is always a must especially if you order the prime rib - be ready for a show :)"

That $9.99 for 2 shawarma deal is lunch only. Normal price is $6 each. Chicken was meh. And the guy was very stingy with the meat. Not worth it at all. I ordered samousas afterwards (2 for $3.50) and those were meh too.  Cheap? More like a rip off. I have had cheaper and tastier shawarmas before.

The only down fall was that some of the employees would congregate by the bar area, goof off and be really inappropriate.  My advice is to notify the management if you see this behavior so they finally understand that this is the main reason they have a bad rep!"

Would suggest other places over this one like improvMANIA, The Torch, or even The Jesterz if you are looking for ""clean comedy"". I would not go back."

If you're going to eat there, the decor is rather simple... it's nice and clean for sure.... but generally when I order Chinese it's takeout anyway.  Spring rolls and potstickers are top notch - pot stickers have the option of steamed or fried, which is nice (I prefer them steamed).  All the main courses we've ordered from here have been awesome - no complaints at all. The people working there seem super nice too.  Best Chinese in SW Charlotte for sure."

The crust was perfect, the mix of veggies was on the point and the amount of goat cheese was just right. I am usually skeptical sometimes when it comes to goat cheese, it can take over the taste and ruin the flavour of the meal.   The cocktails are pretty fabulous, and the service was great."

The burger came with chips and coleslaw, all of which were subpar.  Our ice cream desserts however, made up for the burger and sides.

Mix of soft and wood seating. Pleasant staff. As I write this, small coffee is $2.50, medium  $2.75, and large  $3. Top quality, so you get what you pay for. Sure, a mc griddle and a large coffee can be gotten for  $2...but fast food chain ambiance and generic food aren't what cafes are about."

I probably won't go back just because I think I can get the food I want elsewhere for less.   I will say it was clean and nicely decorated, so if you want to dine in then it would be worth it."

The food is well spiced and the selection great. I frequently eat Indian food and there were items I had never tried before. Highly recommend except to those that can't handle spices.

I like various Phos and fried rice there. Waitresses/Waiters there are professional, and even when there are many people eating there, you can expect your dishes coming in the reasonable amount of time.  Moreover, you can use the ""belly"" card to earn points and get free drinks, phos and fried rice. Overall, 5 stars."

Made right in front of you and if you add meat, I think they grill it while you are waiting.  Very fresh! Now with their wine selection, and the way they dim the lights and place candles on the table - it makes it a great dinner/date place. The staff/service is very friendly, too."

Nothing in the ambiance department. (Unless you feel that Subway and Starbucks are the height of class) - but quick and tasty. Limited seating."

My brother's shrimp gnocchi dish was fishy smelling and tasting, my crab fish dish tasted like cheap frozen fish or old fish. However, the 2nd night we ordered Italian and were very satisfied. We enjoyed both the Mediterranean and the Caesar salads and then a pizza and a stuffed pizza (their version of a calzone). Definitely go Italian."

There's a coffee bar, drinks and snacks are available at the cafe.  Nice lounge area with a flat screen for daddies that couldn't do without sports.

The music was loud and annoying sorta rap and the people walking around picking up plates were more attentive than the waiter. The sushi was more expensive and in smaller quantity, with the specialty sushi not being memorable. Same for their saki choices.  I guess for being a sports bar sushi joint it must have been ok, but that's not what I went for. Sorry"

The cabs are virtually non-existent after 5 PM.  Forget going out to a different club or hotel after dark.  Rooms are pretty nice for the price - elevators seem to be from the 1930's and take forever - stay on the 1st floor if you want to save time.  Definitely not worth the money unless you don't have much."

The decor is more American/Asian inspired put together.   I first fell in love with their garlic noodles, chicken wings with fish sauce, grilled squid and so on and so forth. And you have to have their coconut ice cream.   One thing though, when they get busy or late at night, parking here it's hard to find."

It gets pretty packed in there on weekends.  Service is no nonsense.  Best is the beer selection in the cave.  This is the reason for the 4stars.

They keep the maintenance cost down by using their trusted contractors.  The best and kind of unusual service is that Kelly interviews new tenants in their current residence to see the condition of home.  If their current home is well kept then he knows the new applicant will take care of my property."

It's truly all love in the service.

The Chow Kwai Tiu was also mediocre. The calamari and shrimp were pretty small. The sauce was slightly spicy, which was good.  All in all, a mediocre lunch at ~$11/person."

Instead, they had it out for me in less than 10 minutes. The woman behind the counter was very accommodating, polite, and nice. The food itself was decent. It's pretty much your standard Chinese-American takeout place so you know what you're gonna get, though the crab puffs I thought were particularly delicious.

I've never had any problems talking to any of the employees here and found them quite helpful.  I've tried RMS and Petco. This is my go to store. I've had problems they have immediately assisted.

The service was fine and the food came out in a timely fashion.  I was somewhat reticent to go after reading the pther Yelp reviews but experienced none of the conditions depicted in previous reviews.  The fact that they all menyioned yhe same vompetitor makes me wonder if there aren't some shenanigans going on.  My advice is to try it if you like brick oven thin crust pizza.  You won't be disappointed.

The boss seemed to rush through everything and did not pay much attention to the details. It took less than 10 mins to finish the whole thing. And yeah, even though it was fine, I expected more for this price. So if you want more finesse, maybe you need to find another place."

What is with these companies closing their locations down and making locals wait years for a new establishment that has less to offer than their previous location? Terrible way to earn your old customers back. Seems like a trend happening in Vegas and its really doing bad for tourism when all the companies are just penny-pinching and reopening shitty locations. Dont reopen if you can't deliver!

Oh and the bread pudding dessert is the best ever bread pudding. Try the cocktails- found that it went great with the food and an option to opt out of their lengthy and expensive wine menu.

The bread baskets are a meal in themselves since each type of bread is delicious you have to try them all.  Ordered the salmon which could easily be the best meal I've ever had in Vegas and maybe the U.S.  Pricing is steep but no steeper than any other dining establishment in Vegas.

The atmosphere on the patio and by the bar is unique and makes for a relaxed setting. It is one of my favorite places to dine in Pittsburgh. Some favorites are the ricotta cavatelli (all timer) and their lamb dishes. We always start with a cheese plate and I think its one of the best in town. Keep it going Casbah for many more years to come!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the younger kids area is small, which is normal, but they allow up to 6 year olds.  A small kids area should go to about 3.  The difference in coordination and development is huge in those ages and the 4-6 year old were running around dominating the area when there is plenty of other places that they could be playing."

Everything else was just okay.   Lunch was also okay.   The prices are very expensive for the quality of food. This place certainly beats going to a buffet though."

This is essentially a meal of an apple fritter, I'm still stuffed 2 hours post devouring.  Simply put, best $1.65 I've spent in a long time.    - Brad VP"

The food is good, but the wait is ridiculous. There is no reason for almost an hour wait between receiving our appetizer and our entrees. Drinks were empty for probably 30 minutes of that time. This place needs to get their act together with the scheduling. After coming here weekend after weekend experiencing the same issue we can clearly see there's a problem that those who come every once in awhile do not."

Tasteless green chili macaroni and some lasagna concoction that tasted like it was cooked 7 hours before it was served to us. Thanks but I literally have to run to the toilet...

Modern, with good music and an attentive staff. We ordered the all you can eat $25 dinner. We also indulged in the 2 for 1 alcoholic beverages. That special runs all day everyday! Food was good, fast and fresh! Definitely way better than Yamaha sushi across the street. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to sign yourself in on a waiting list upon entering.

The menu is huge, there are too many fresh dishes to choose from that you'll be stuck for choice. They have a Wed and Sun special which is superb and they deliver. This place is always packed; its quite a small place, but even if it was five times larger it would still be packed as people come back again and again."

The place isn't very big but the decor is really nice and they have a bar that gets packed on weekends.the sandwiches are reasonable priced all under $10.00. I like that there served on fresh Italian bread but it's hard to taste the fish or meat on it because of the French fries and coleslaw. I know it's a Pittsburgh tradition but after a few sandwiches I've lost my taste for them.

Fees like that are illegal in other states because they are exploiting customers. So I bought a Mercedes in Oh for thousands less and a reasonable $295 admin fee. I don't mind paying a fair price but refuse to pay and uninformed and inflated price.

The video clip were not so great and they showed one of John's assassination and then went right back to the show with all of them.  Still an enjoyable performance, make sure you get the BOGO deal."

We waited for around 20 minutes and it was definitely worth the short wait time. The apple butter that goes on the biscuits could be addictive, if I lived closer. I would recommend this place to anyone in the area or visiting."

You'll sample everything they're currently brewing... Want more? Just ask. They work hard to keep your glass full. My favorite is Tahoe Blue, but a number of others were great. There were only a few I didn't much care for and those were with heavy chocolate, coconut and pumpkin. It was great fun to learn about local brews. And taste them, too, of course. Highly recommended!"

But off late they changed the staff a lot and you see the difference. I went for waxing, the lady assigned to me was doing it so slowly and delicately making it painful. Also the pricing for waxing is inconsistent. They charged me extra $5 for no reason, and when I asked about it they said we'll waive it off! disgruntled right there. I would recommend this place only for nail jobs and nothing else."

The spa at Paris, is the worst place I have ever seen.  It is unkept, dirty, scummy and smells like dirty feet.  The facilities are horrible.  The attendant frankly lazy and rude. Do not waste a penny.  I have seen high school gyms more appealing."

I usually continue to visit because it is a classic sit in diner and I just like the feel of it. Seating can be uncomfortable if you're there for a long bit of time since it's wooden benches, booths, and chairs. They have a little gift shop so to speak but nothing really pops."

In the states, target actually competes with Walmart, not so much in canada.   Their website isn't even up yet, at least not the shopping section.   Pros: exclusive line of clothing and food products. Cons: not competitively priced like their u.s. counterpart.  In my book, walmart is still better."

And all I needed was to rotate the tires period they informed me that I should cancel my Groupon because they did not want to charge me for services not rendered. Who does that?"

Scallops - smoked cauliflower, peas, nuts and oranges...incredible balance of citrus, smoke and crunch that is all ridiculously fresh letting the flavors work.

I have eaten at Gates and Brovi about 5-6 times now, and never been particularly impressed with anything beyond apps and burgers. I like their wines by the glass, and it's an okay happy hour option, but the entrees I've tried tend to be bland and not very filling for the price. Plus the service is pretty hit or miss.

They were out of chips (no chips at a Mexican restaurant?!) They were out of lettuce. Black beans were crunchy (must have just come out of the can). Bathrooms were gross. Tables had not been wiped down and cleaned. This was on a Saturday night at 8 pm, so it was inexcusable to not have the basic food items available."
