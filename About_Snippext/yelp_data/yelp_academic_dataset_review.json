Ingredients are everything, and everything I see and taste here tells me that they're using top-grade fresh ingredients. The brisket sandwich is probably my favorite... and it's the one my wife ALWAYS gets. Unlike her, I often bounce around the menu to try different things. Definitely a step up from Subway, Quiznos, Jimmy Johns, etc in my opinion. As with all of my reviews, I grade each place relative to what I perceive to be its peers - so five star compared to them.","date":"2013-05-07 07:25:25"}

Although service took little extra time but I have no complaints since they are quite new in business. The green curry chicken was good and to the right spice balance I asked for. I will definitely recommend this place to others.","date":"2015-11-05 23:11:05"}
